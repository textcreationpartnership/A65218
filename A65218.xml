            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In his Preface to the Reader,</hi> he ſuppoſed (as a <hi>principle</hi> between him and thoſe with whom he <hi>would diſpute.</hi>) That a man may be <hi>aſſured by an infallibly divine faith, that the received Scriptures, are the dictates of Gods Spirit;</hi> this he attempted not to prove afreſh, it being already done (in our Church) even unto <hi>aſtoniſhment,</hi> and in <hi>ever living cedar,</hi> written in the <hi>Book of Jaſher;</hi> wherein the <hi>great Author</hi> (though dead, yet) ſpeaketh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Concluſions</hi> which <hi>he proved,</hi> and which <hi>there</hi> (as <hi>here</hi>) he deſired to have <hi>admitted,</hi> were,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, that the Canonical Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament, (acknowledged by the Church of England) as dictated by the Spirit of God, are to be held the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial rule of all controverſies and doubts in points of Religion, for ſo long as the world ſhall endure, containing all things neceſſary to ſalvation: ſo as all thoſe, who with humility and ſobriety, will make uſe of the meanes therein expreſſed; may attaine unto ſufficient direction for the ſame, through the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim and thunnus, covenanted in them to be left unto Gods Church for ever. And that other revelations are not now to be expected, and different revelations to be abhorred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, that every good tranſlation is according to the Word of God; but no tranſlation is the Word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, that the Spirit of God hath not throughout the Book of God, one word or tittle, which hath not its own, proper, and beneficial weight: neither is there in any particle thereof, any thing ſavoring of humane frailty; either in deficiency, or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity, for the juſt expreſſion of the matter therein propoſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, that the great Creator of Names hath not himſelf given a name to any thing, but ſo, that his name is a complete character of the nature of the thing it ſelfe; which humane ability, joyned with modeſty and induſtry, may in a competent meaſure diſcerne.</hi> There be, who with great <hi>probability</hi> affirme thus much of the <hi>names,</hi> which <hi>Adam</hi> gave the <hi>beaſts</hi> in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly, that where the Spirit of God makes uſe of a word of different ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; they were all intended by God, and are applicable to man, as uſefull for ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly, that no place of Scripture, being of private interpretation; the obſcure Texts are (according to the analogy of faith) to be expounded by thoſe which are cleare: and thoſe which ſeem to goe alone, by thoſe which are more. And that according to that of Pſal. 119. 130. it is Pethach Devarecha, apertio ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Theſe things he <hi>juſtified</hi> from ſeveral <hi>plates</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> of them
<pb facs="tcp:102603:7"/>
from that <hi>particular Text of Deut. 29. 29. Secret things (belong) unto the Lord our God, and revealed things to us and our children for ever; that we might doe [all the words] of this Law.</hi> Which will be evident unto every man who ſhall look <hi>underſtandingly</hi> and <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> into the words in the <hi>original</hi> of that <hi>Text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To theſe were added the enſuing Cautions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, that unto him, who in points of difference adventures alone to expound Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, no caution, no modeſty can be too much;</hi> one ſide or the other of us having run upon the <hi>rock of perdition,</hi> in the <hi>Expoſition</hi> of <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, that in matters of moment,</hi> (ſuch are the controverſies which have drawn ſo much <hi>bloud</hi> amongſt us) <hi>great heed is to be taken, how we depart from the interpretations recorded by the ancient Fathers, and received by the whole Catholique Church: That thus to doe, is an argument of an evil cauſe, or of an evil man; in as much, as they who were the Schollers of the inſpired Apoſtles, (who were careful diſpenſers of all ſaving truths;) or the ſchollers of them who were ſo, cannot but be ſurer maſters of the Apoſtles meanings, then we of the laſt age. And they cannot but (with ſerious men) diſgrace themſelves, (what ever they may faſten upon weak and wilful capacities) who deny the uniforme practice of all ages, to be the beſt Expoſitor of what was decreed at firſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, that the Plea uſed by many, (but moſt of all by thoſe who leaſt reverence the Fathers) that a dwarf ſet upon the ſhoulders of a gyant, ſees further then the gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant himſelf, may be dangerouſly fallacious; it holds not, if the dwarf be pur-blind, and cannot ſee what is afar off, if his ſight cannot reach to the gyant whom he tramples on, if of his own or other mens prejudicial chooſing, he weares falſe ſpectacles, which make that look blew which is white: If he have an evil heart, which will not give him leave to ſee what he does, and report what be ſees, he cannot be a juſt witneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Concerning</hi> the <hi>judgment</hi> of the <hi>one Catholique Church,</hi> (to wit, which hath been in <hi>all ages and places,</hi> and which none can contemn, but to the <hi>infamy of the age and nation,</hi> which doth or ſuffereth it) what <hi>honourable eſteem</hi> ſoever he hath of it, accounting it the beſt of all <hi>Topical arguments;</hi> yet he is conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to wave all <hi>affiance</hi> therein, and that <hi>this controverſie</hi> ſhould be <hi>magiſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally determined,</hi> onely by <hi>demonſtrative arguments,</hi> from <hi>ſcientifical divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> in the <hi>ſacred Scripture,</hi> relying onely upon that <hi>light</hi> (in the preſent caſe) which <hi>Scripture</hi> ſhall <hi>bring</hi> to <hi>Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Their predeceſſours,</hi> who (in this our age) firſt ſtirred up the <hi>people</hi> in this <hi>controverſie, powerfully</hi> wrought upon the <hi>unjudicious many;</hi> by calling for <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Scripture,</hi> for the warranty of all <hi>meerly humane actions, and conſtitutions:</hi> but <hi>now</hi> the <hi>ſucceſſors</hi> (in theſe dayes) having reaped the <hi>benefit</hi> of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>deſert</hi> the former <hi>principle,</hi> ſo far forth, that <hi>mans prudential rules are advanced into that place of Scripture,</hi> in the <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>religious Worſhip.</hi> And in the <hi>higheſt</hi> of <hi>humane concernments</hi> (even againſt the <hi>divine ſoveraignty of</hi> the GOD of <hi>nature,</hi> indeed) <hi>arguments</hi> are pretended from the <hi>lawes of nature unwritten;</hi> and thoſe againſt the <hi>written,</hi> both <hi>rules and exemplifications</hi> in <hi>Scripture:</hi> in this
<pb facs="tcp:102603:8"/>
               <hi>point</hi> which he hath <hi>evidently</hi> and <hi>frequently</hi> therein <hi>declared,</hi> to be his own <hi>Prerogative Royal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As concerning the <hi>pretenders</hi> to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>new Light;</hi> we read, that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of GOD <hi>ſearcheth all things,</hi> in the deep <hi>mysteries</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10. Let it be the <hi>firſt trial</hi> of their <hi>ſpirits,</hi> to give us a <hi>cleer</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controllable Commentary</hi> in the <hi>firſt place,</hi> upon that <hi>word</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> which GOD hath <hi>revealed</hi> unto us, before we <hi>truſt</hi> them in <hi>things unrevealed,</hi> which GOD hath reſerved in his <hi>cloud</hi> and <hi>unacceſſible darkneſſe:</hi> and <hi>particularly,</hi> upon the <hi>eight laſt Chapters</hi> of the <hi>Prophecy</hi> of <hi>Ezekiel;</hi> which, (if it prove not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves) is like to make a <hi>Proſelyte</hi> of this <hi>Author;</hi> otherwiſe, they may pardon us, if we be apt to eſteem of them, but as of <hi>vainly proud idle children,</hi> ambitious of <hi>new leſſons,</hi> before they have taken out their <hi>former.</hi> Whileſt we acknowlege the <hi>Scriptures abſolute perfection,</hi> and the <hi>execrations</hi> therein expreſſed upon all, who ſhall expect a <hi>further light</hi> from GOD, (much more a <hi>contrary</hi>) for the <hi>whole for ever</hi> of this <hi>world.</hi> And that GOD <hi>almighty</hi> (having <hi>ſealed</hi> the <hi>Canon</hi>) hath therein <hi>moſt graciouſly provided</hi> (in <hi>plain lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi>) as fitting <hi>entertainment, ſufficient</hi> for the <hi>ſalvation</hi> of all <hi>humble ſoules;</hi> and <hi>directions,</hi> whereby they may <hi>try</hi> the <hi>ſpirits</hi> of <hi>pretenders:</hi> ſo hath he for the <hi>manifeſtation</hi> of his <hi>glory,</hi> intermixed <hi>inexplicable myſteries</hi> alſo, becoming the <hi>high majeſty</hi> of his <hi>own wiſdome,</hi> to teach <hi>proud men, humble reverence;</hi> or to <hi>befool</hi> the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of bold <hi>pretenders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now concerning the ſervants of GOD, our <hi>Worthies,</hi> who have written in this <hi>controverſie;</hi> divers of them have for this long time laboured with <hi>Chriſtian meekneſſe and patience,</hi> (by degrees) to make that <hi>ſtreight</hi> which is <hi>diſtorted:</hi> and for the <hi>hardneſſe</hi> of <hi>mens hearts,</hi> have preſſed <hi>chiefly,</hi> the <hi>honeſty</hi> of <hi>Obedience,</hi> from the <hi>paction</hi> between the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Subject;</hi> according, either to the <hi>general law</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> (out of which, for that it is unwritten, men eaſily take what they pleaſe, not what they ſhould) or the <hi>particular lawes</hi> of <hi>particular Nations,</hi> which men, that have gotten the <hi>maſtery</hi> over, trample upon as they liſt; ſo that many conceive the ſtrength of GODS <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi> by them alledged, to be <hi>founded,</hi> either upon the <hi>heaps of duſt</hi> impoſed by <hi>mens hands</hi> upon the <hi>law of nature,</hi> or the <hi>ſand</hi> of <hi>municipal conſtitutions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe Arguments being rejected,</hi> though not indeed <hi>anſwered;</hi> we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to tell the world, That, <hi>non ſic fuit ab initio,</hi> from the <hi>beginning</hi> it was <hi>not ſo: that</hi> they who <hi>created</hi> not themſelves, muſt be contented to be <hi>governed,</hi> both <hi>as,</hi> and <hi>by whom,</hi> he that <hi>made</hi> them hath <hi>appointed:</hi> and, that <hi>in terminis,</hi> he hath ſet down his <hi>forme,</hi> and <hi>deſigned</hi> the <hi>men,</hi> by <hi>which</hi> and <hi>whom,</hi> he (without whom the whole <hi>creature</hi> can have no <hi>power</hi> at all) hath <hi>covenanted</hi> to rule them, for ſo long as the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon ſhall endure.</hi> And alſo, to be the <hi>peoples remembrancers</hi> of their duty in this caſe, the very ſame with the obligations of the <hi>former Iſrael of God,</hi> unto thoſe by him entruſted with the <hi>adminiſtration</hi> of <hi>his powers:</hi> and, that the <hi>ſin</hi> of <hi>diſobedience</hi> is in

From whence (briefly, for the preſent) appears, <hi>That by the Doctrine of the Scriptures, no Power of Dominion is Originally in the People, but, that all ſuch Power is abſolutely in Chriſt; and this in Relative Oppoſition to them.</hi> Now, though my chiefe aime be not to be an Anſwerer of particular Objections, (eſpecially thoſe not grounded upon my Principle, the Word of God) but to take them away in general, by diſſolving that Principle whereupon they are built: And though this that followeth, properly belongeth to the eleventh Chapter, yet for a timely and faire Compliance with thoſe, to whom this Brotherly Concertation is directed, I ſhall (here) endevour to prevent the miſunderſtanding of that Text of Saint <hi>John 18. 36. My King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is not of this World; if it were, then would my Servants ſurely fight,</hi> &amp;c.

Secondly, the Words cannot be ſo underſtood; as if they implyed, that there are in this world Kingdoms, which are <hi>Originally</hi> of this World; though that which belongeth unto Chriſt ſhould not prove ſo: For (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to the Scripture Doctrine every where, in this point) the Faithfull and True Witneſſe, replyed unto the Roman General, (in the next Chapter Verſe 11.) <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="25">25. Thirdly, the words themſelves (as ſhall appear by ſome few of the multitudes of Texts which might be produced) cannot bear out this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; That any Juſt Power ſhould be Originally of this World. The Words are theſe, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="26">26. Thus 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 47. The <hi>firſt Adam</hi> (who alſo was of Celeſtiall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent; <hi>The Son of God, Luke 3. 38. And of the Breath of God, Gen.</hi> 2. 7.) was ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Of the Earth, earthy;</hi> as the <hi>Second was</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>the Lord of, and from Heaven,</hi> notwithſtanding that he had taken Fleſh from the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi> And it followes in the next Verſe, <hi>And as is the Earthy, ſuch are they that are Earthly; and as the Heavenly, ſuch are they that are Heavenly;</hi> which I hope <hi>Chriſtians</hi> pretend to be: ſo that it is the <hi>Suchneſſe</hi> that here <hi>Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates.</hi> But I forbear further Proofs in a point ſo plaine.</p>
               <p n="27">27. So then it appears, that it is (now eſpecially) an unchriſtian Speech, to ſay that Kingdome <hi>in Abſtracto,</hi> conſidered in it ſelfe (as it is falſe and Traiterous to ſay that the Kings Perſon is <hi>Filius Populi,</hi> or begotten by the Multitude) is of the World; to wit, of the Men thereof, or People, if GOD and his Chriſt have or ever had the Regiment of this round World, and all therein. The Diſciples were not of this World, after that by Chriſts Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from <hi>Above</hi> it, they were Called out of its Community, not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe; and differenced thereby from ſuch who held of the common Uſages of the World, whether Legal or Illegal: and yet before, were not (them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) <hi>Abſolutely</hi> and <hi>Originally</hi> of the World, in as much, as they were the ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> who was the ſon of God; who in regard of his Biaſs (ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after his Origination) deſerved juſtly the Perſonal <hi>Diminution and Motto</hi> of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or Power,) and that in his principal Part, he was of the <hi>Breath or Spirit of God;</hi> ſo that ſince Kings have now their Calling and Commiſſion from GOD and his Chriſt, that which was alwayes Improper, is here Unchriſtian; to wit, to Affirm, that any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kingdome is held of the World or People.</p>
               <p n="28">28. And now to look back to the Text of Saint <hi>John;</hi> ſince no Power of Dominion could ever properly and truly be ſaid to be of the World, <hi>in re ipſu,</hi> it muſt be underſtood of the <hi>Modus;</hi> and that it is either of the Worlds <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage, or Miſuſage:</hi> it is too narrow for Chriſt to reſtraine it to the latter, as if there were no more (therein) ſaid for him, then that his Kingdom ſhould (onely) not be according to the Corrupt thinkings of the World, founded upon that falſe Principle, that Men were the Makers of Kings; mankind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then generally gone aſtray from that firſt Truth, (which cooled but by degrees) looking down onely to the Fruit on the Ground, and not to the Tree that bare it; rather magnifying of, and rendering their Thankes to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102603:18"/>
the unruly Winde that blew it downe amongſt them, then to the Branch that brought it forth.</p>
               <p n="29">29. That it muſt be meant alſo of the lawfull Uſage of this World, is plaine by that Note of Diſtinction, which himſelfe (in the next words) ſet upon that which was his own ſeverall, wherein he ſtands not upon the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude and Bounds of his Dominion, nor upon the Celſitude and Glory thereof, but differenceth it from thoſe of the beſt uſage of the World, by the contracted Humility and Peaceableneſſe of it: <hi>If my Kingdome were of this World, then would my Servants ſurely fight, that I ſhould not be delivered up into Jewiſh hands:</hi> From whence it followes, that it is the duty of all Subjects who will not (for company) turn Jewes unto the Kings of this World, to fight for them in this Caſe. And alſo, that no man may fight for that which is <hi>Chriſts Kingdome,</hi> diſparate from that which is his <hi>Deputies,</hi> with, and under him; which is the Chiefe falſe colour of theſe dayes, for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Wars. In this great Point, Chriſt will magnifie himſelf by his Patience, in that which his Vicegerents may not ſuffer, nor their Subjects ought to endure; for that which is onely <hi>his,</hi> thoſe who are his, muſt <hi>Suffer,</hi> not <hi>Fight;</hi> for that which concerneth his <hi>Deputies</hi> (according to the Doctrine of the Scriptures) they ſhall <hi>ſurely fight</hi> or ſuffer from him.</p>
               <p n="30">30. And it cannot be doubted of, but that in due time, he will in his own Cauſe make triall of that his Power, which in the plenitude of his Juſtice he denyed not to the Devil, <hi>Judg. 6. 31. Let Baal plead his own Cauſe, will you ſave him? If he be a God, let him plead for himſelf.</hi> GOD is diſhonoured, if there be pleading by the Sword for that Power, which he hath not communicated to Man; He is diſhonoured, if there be not pleading by the Sword for that Power, which he hath imparted to his Vicegerent. The <hi>Material</hi> Sword is too <hi>Material,</hi> to cut out <hi>Spiritualties;</hi> it is made to protect <hi>Temporalties,</hi> and eſpecially the <hi>Protectors</hi> thereof. In this particular, for what he hath conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in Man, amongſt Men, and for Mankind, he hath declared that he will be helped by all Men; and thoſe (in this caſe) <hi>who come not out to help the Lord, are children of the Curſe:</hi> Thoſe, to a man, (of what condition ſoever) who upon the ſetting up of the Standard and Proclamation Royal, Array not themſelves with their beſt abilities to aid the <hi>Lords Anointed</hi> (as ſhall be proved, <hi>Chap. 6. Par.</hi> 31. &amp;c.) the Spirit of GOD brandeth with the Stile of ſons of Belial, and giveth it forth as a mark of Religion, upon thoſe who come forth to Aſſiſt him; they that Reſiſt him being the Authors of their own Damnation: as hath been proved to mine hands.</p>
               <p n="31">31. But for the Propagation of his Religion, the true GOD never yet raiſed a War, if the <hi>Scriptures</hi> be all of his mind that we may preſume to know, and his mind now immutably that which was his former; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly for the Inſtauration of the new Covenant, not the Mighty men of this World were by Chriſt employed for that End, but he choſe the weake
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102603:18"/>
things to confound the ſtrong: So that evidently, War for Religion (for any thing that GOD hath manifeſted) is Irreligious, yea himſelfe (<hi>A Lamb without blemiſh</hi>) would not have his own Perſon blemiſhed, by having it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by the <hi>Sword;</hi> though he could have commanded <hi>more then twelve Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of Angels for his guard:</hi> but he left us his example, and bequeathed us men, that ſhould doe it by Suffering, whoſe Precepts and Examples have been hitherto precious unto all thoſe, who have made the Word of GOD their Guide, and Heaven their Goale.</p>
               <p n="32">32. GOD grant that we who are now (by him) thought worthy to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, for and like our Maſter and his Schollers, may not puſillanimouſly diſtaine the glorious Patience, and Self-deniall, whereby our (One) Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion hath formerly, and for ever Out-ſhined and Extinguiſhed the Gayeſt and Activeſt, of all the Creations of humane Fancy, or diabolicall Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry. And that in this Agony, we may be ſtrengthned and comforted, for the parting with All, rather then with our Allegiance, without which, there never was, nor can be <hi>Religion;</hi> as ſhall be proved. That in this Cauſe, we may be accompliſhed with Courage, not onely to be willing to dye more gloriouſly then ſome can be willing we ſhould; but alſo, to dare to live more miſerable, then many dare to look upon: Looking unto <hi>Jeſus, the Captain and Finiſher of our Salvation, made Perfect through his ſufferings:</hi> And into his [<hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they doe.</hi>] Unto the glorious company of the Apoſtles and Biſhops,—<hi>Animaeque magnae—Prodigum Paulum:</hi> And into his, [<hi>I could wiſh my ſelfe to be an Anathema for my Brethren.</hi>] Unto the goodly Fellowſhip of the Prophets and Doctors; and into their ſundry <hi>Teaching Deaths, and Living Writings.</hi> Unto the noble Army of Martyrs and Confeſſors; and into the Protomartyrs, [<hi>Lord lay not this ſin to their charge.</hi>] Unto the numerous Primitive Legionaries; and into their [<hi>Steterunt Torti, Torquentibus Fortiores.</hi>] Unto our own moſt Reverend Heads;—<hi>Abſcidit vultus enſis uterque ſacros—Hoc tibi, &amp;c.</hi> And into their <hi>Cygneae cantiones,—dolorque feſſus,—Quicquid fleverat ante, nunc adoret.</hi> And laſtly, unto unto the greateſt of all <hi>Confeſſours,</hi> our <hi>Living Martyr,</hi> the likeſt of all Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, to him who <hi>was Dead, and is alive;—<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t ſolus ſtat puppe magiſter—Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigil, anguſtáque Deus qui navigat alno!</hi>—<hi>Meruitque timeri—Nil metuens!</hi> and into his two great Faults, <hi>Innocency,</hi> and <hi>Over-merit.</hi> And then, let us repent our abhorring of this preſent evill World, if we can, and let fall our moſt Chriſtian ſcorn of enjoying our Poſſeſſions, before he doth his, if we be able: and thinke of ſecuring of our lives, before his, whom the Spirit of GOD hath taught us to account the <hi>Breath of our noſtrils,</hi> if we meane to loſe them, and more.</p>

And therefore, it ſhould be ſo here, to promote the Glory of his <hi>Repreſenter</hi> on earth, and not to leſſen his <hi>Prerogative;</hi> for feare of him who can diſcerne, whether it be Himſelfe or his Deputy that is diminiſhed. And hence alſo appears the Excellency of Monarchy, in that, it alone is to continue, in that which is our true Countrey. But I proceed.</p>

                  <p>A briefe Digreſsion, that the Power entruſted to Kings cannot but be Divine, by the unqueſtionableneſſe thereof. <hi>Job 34. 16.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and the Expoſition juſtified by parallel Texts. The Queſtion anſwered, What if the King turne Tyrant? An Anſwer to a <hi>Scotch</hi> Topick.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. BEfore I proceed in the Sacred Story, the generall Importunity of the times cals for a ſhort <hi>Digreſſion,</hi> for the Juſtification of GOD, when he ſhall ſet up in that Place and Power which is his Chriſts, a Tyrannous vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator of his People and Religion: who loves both better then we deſerve; but will not have us to teach him. Whereas the People ſhould be taught, that if he could doe (that which he cannot) againſt the rule of Juſtice, they have no authority <hi>to lay their hand upon his neck;</hi> and to bring and hold him to that <hi>Rule;</hi> but that whatſoever he doth, he doth alwayes that which is either beſt or fitteſt for the Generality; upto which, particular mens caſes and humors muſt ſtoop; all Religious mens, will. Where I ſhall lay down
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102603:20"/>
this Principle, That <hi>the Power which is by mankind <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nqueſtionable and Irreſiſtible, muſt needs be Divine. Et è converſo.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. The place which I ſhall chiefly (herein) inſiſt upon, was (before the Law given by <hi>Moſes</hi>) uttered as a Truth, which no underſtanding man was then ignorant of, <hi>Job 34. 16, 17, 18. If thou haſt underſtanding, hear this;</hi>

                  <hi>and hearken to the voyce of my words: [Shall he that hateth Judgement, Governe?]</hi> (or Irreſiſtibly oblige?) <hi>And wilt thou make him wicked who is moſt Juſt? Wilt thou ſay unto a King, thou art wicked? or to Princes, you are ungodly?</hi>] Were ſuch a Prince the peoples Deputy, the People might queſtion their own; but in as much as he is the Viceroy of the only Potentate, (<hi>The King of kings, and Lord of lords</hi>) he is onely Queſtionable by him. Did they conferre his Power, and that upon Articles between them, before a competent Superiour Power, they might Implead him, and peradventure Diveſt him: but in as much as <hi>His</hi> is his Power, who is all Power, it muſt be onely he that muſt Diſpower him, or give bounds to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Man may be well content to heare that GOD is not unjuſt, if he give his juſt Title to the Beſt of things unto the Worſt of men, and the Worſt unto the Beſt; unto whom he knowes very well how to make amends: and knows as wel, that the Beſt of the world deſerve not the worlds Worſt things. This (in this particular caſe) hath the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> from the Lord, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted for the Lord, <hi>Jer. 27. 5. Thus ſaith the Lord, I have made the Earth, the Man and the Beaſt, that are upon the ground; and have given it to whom it ſeemed meet to me. And now, I have given all theſe Lands into the bands of Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar my Servant,</hi> (though both a Tyrannicall and Idolatrous one) <hi>and the Beaſts of the field have I given him to ſerve him.</hi> This is GODS <hi>Prerogative,</hi> and man muſt ſubmit; his Betters have ever (in all Ages which knew what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to Religion) done ſo; yea the Son himſelf.</p>

                  <hi>What doest thou?</hi> This (when GOD was upon the Thoughts of ſetting up the Heathen <hi>Cyrus,</hi> for the Monarch of the World) was the Prophets Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the <hi>Lords Prerogative.</hi> And that it may be known (by his God-like exemption) whoſe Miniſter the <hi>King</hi> is; the Spirit of GOD ſayes the like of the <hi>King, Eccleſ. 8. 4.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102603:21"/>
man will let him alone) what he hath to doe with him, and hath given Commiſſion to ſome to Informe him, but to none to Reſiſt him; or to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine him againſt his will: This is the Prerogative of the moſt High; as, <hi>Pſal. 76. 12. He ſhall Reſtraine the Spirit of Princes, and is wonderfull amongſt (or dreadfull to) the Kings of the Earth;</hi> but hath given liberty to none to <hi>diſhonour them before the People,</hi> though they will not be Informed, but perſiſt in their deſtructive wayes, even to the Bloud of GODS <hi>Anointed Prieſts,</hi> and the prophaning of Religion: Prophaned, Injured Religion cryes out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt prophaner Hands which touch its <hi>Anointed</hi> Perſecuter; and GOD will have the Glory to be the Recompenſer of thoſe who perſiſt in their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, while they ſuffer unjuſtly.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Heaven is not grown elder and worſe, then it was heretofore, nor we better, then he that led, and they that followed thus the way to Heaven; neither can we (for my part, I ſincerely beleeve it) excuſe our ſelves to GOD, or them (at the laſt day) if we flatter the People, (though but through our ſilence) in not accounting to them, that theſe and the like places of GODS <hi>Word,</hi> have ever carried this ſenſe, throughout the whole <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> ever ſince they were uttered and received, until theſe <hi>Antichriſtian Times.</hi> That <hi>Chriſt</hi> laid down his life in this Profeſſion, hath beene followed by many thouſands of <hi>Martyrs;</hi> unto whoſe Bloud (as to the Efficient and Inſtruments) we owe the Religion that we have.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Our experience may teach us, that there have been ſome evill Princes, whom GOD and time have amended; none that have been ill, that have been Immortall; nor any that have been very ill, that have lived very long; and none ſo ill and long, but the World hath deſerved worſe. But from the evils that ſuch have done to particular men, GOD hath extracted good; the greateſt good that might be unto the <hi>Church</hi> in generall: and hath given the Injured parties ſuch Compenſation, that they would not for the whole world have been without their <hi>Sufferings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. But ſuppoſe ſo wretched a Tyrant as yet never hath been, worſe then the Roman <hi>Nero,</hi> the worſt that Story can produce; of whom yet we can hardly imagine, that he hated that which was good, becauſe it was good; which if he did not, we will readily imagine that none ever did: Yet Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> who ſuffered under him, in this Point, pleaded his Cauſe to the whole world, and to all poſterity; and enjoyned the (then) preſent world to plead in Heaven for him, unto the Lord of Heaven; and in them, all generations (though for the like Princes) to ſend up the like Prayers.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But (as I ſaid) many Tyrants have done wickedly, yet we may conceive, rather for Inordinate love of wicked Ends, then for the Hatred of Juſtice, as it is Juſtice; ſo far forth, that they ſhould hate it in the <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> that enjoyneth it. Yet grant we, that GOD ſhould permit to a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102603:21"/>
wicked people, a wicked King, who ſhould openly and <hi>ex Profeſſo,</hi> hate that which is right, becauſe it is right; yea, the very Law of common Equity, (for ſo <hi>Miſhpat</hi> ſignifieth in this place uſed) yet ſaith that Text, [<hi>Shall ſuch a one Govern?</hi>] and the word for Governing ſignifieth Irreſiſtible to <hi>Oblige</hi> or <hi>Bind. Is it fit to ſay to ſuch a King,</hi> (that hateth <hi>Miſhpat,</hi> the very Head and Fountaine of Juſtice) <hi>Thou art wicked? And to ſuch Princes, you are ungodly?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. The Reaſon is after aſſigned (if we can with Chriſtian Patience wait till GOD ſee his time) in the 24. Verſe; GOD <hi>ſhall breake in pieces mighty men without number, and ſet others, in their ſtead.</hi> And concerning GODS permittance of ſuch Kings, Ver. 23. [<hi>He hath laid no more upon man then is right,</hi> to wit, then man hath deſerved, whenſoever he ſetteth up ſuch) [<hi>That man ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Judgement with</hi> GOD,] that is (as much as in man lieth) to appeale from his Juſtice, and to try an Action with GOD before his betters, as with an Oppreſſour; which is done by mans caſting off of the yoke of thoſe who Sit in the place of GOD yea, by caſting aſperſions upon their Perſons and Actions, even when they doe wickedly, to the diſhonour of GOD, who is able to defend his owne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cauſe, where he will not be defended but by himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Who, when he hath effected the worke of his own ſecret Counſell, the Ends for which he raiſed them up; then (as in the 20. Verſe) <hi>They ſhall in a moment be taken away without hands,</hi> whom no humane hands may ſo much as touch. Upon whom (by reaſon of the holy Oyle in their Anointing) no man whatſoever may lay his hands, and be <hi>Guiltleſſe:</hi> againſt whom no tongue may bark; but is Blaſphemous: and whom no man in his ſecret ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations may vilifie, but his winged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thoughts ſhall make haſte to Him whoſe Dignity he ſuſtaineth. It being a part of GODS <hi>Prerogative,</hi> to be the <hi>Searcher of hearts,</hi> and to ſee into the darkeſt Cells of the ſecreteſt places thereof; for this cauſe he will not endure, that any to whom he hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted any portion of his Prerogative, ſhould be violated in mans ſecreteſt miſ-thoughts; for the Reverence due unto him whoſe Throne he poſſeſſeth; and who hath undertaken, that he wil <hi>turne his Deputies heart which way him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſhall judge moſt fit.</hi> Theſe particulars will further appear in the enſuing Diſcourſe, upon this that hath been proved.</p>

                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:102603:22"/>
and <hi>Radicall mixture</hi> with the King in the <hi>Power of Dominion;</hi> I find (as hath been ſaid) neither ground nor foot-ſtep thereof in holy Scripture: and therefore I ſhall not bend my ſelfe againſt it ſeverally on purpoſe, but as twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with the other, and occaſionally, as it ſhall fall in my way.

And no Power of his is to be arrogated by man, without his ſpeciall Grant; and no Record of any ſuch Patent, can we find in his revealed will; but the contrary.</p>
               <p n="13">13. By this Digreſſion appeareth the Anſwer to the uſuall Queſtion, What if the King turn Tyrant? It might be anſwered by another Queſtion; But, can God turne Tyrant too? And it is eaſily returned, that he cannot. He hath promiſed to turne the Kings heart which way is pleaſing to him; he hath declared, that if the King doe turne Tyrant, the People doe deſerve it; and when they turne good, acknowledging the <hi>Rod of his wrath:</hi> (as <hi>Iſa. 10. 5. Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was) He (to whoſe Prerogative it belongeth) will himſelfe turne the Tyrant out of [His] Throne, which men muſt bow before; as Verſe the 15. <hi>Shall the Axe boaſt it ſelfe against him that heweth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with? Shall the Saw magnifie it ſelfe againſt him that ſhaketh it? As if the Rod ſhould ſhake it ſelfe againſt them that lift it up! Or, as if the ſtaffe ſhould lift up (it ſelfe, as if it were) not wood!</hi> But while they are (being ſo long his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and in his Place over all others) he hath commanded all men to be <hi>Obedient</hi> unto ſuch, as unto the <hi>Lord,</hi> or, for the <hi>Lords</hi> ſake. For that their Power (ſuppoſe in the hands of a <hi>Nero,</hi> or one worſe; an hater of <hi>Miſhpat,</hi> or the Law it ſelfe of Nature, and common Equity) is <hi>Divine.</hi>

Concerning the Scottiſh Topick, a Simily; That the Souldiery may lawfully hold the hands of that General, who will turn his Cannon againſt his Army on purpoſe to deſtroy them; (But where can he get a new one then?) And the Seamen, the hands of that Pilot, who wilfully runs his ſhip againſt the Rock: therefore, the Proceedings of that Nation againſt the King, are lawfull.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Suppoſing even Impoſſibilities probable, yet would the Inference faile. And were the Argument put into Form, it would ſufficiently diſplay it ſelf. But I doe not love to urge any mans Arguments except mine own; I feare to prejudice my friends, and dare not wrong mine adverſaries: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I take it as it is; whereof were the Antecedent true, yet the Conſequence is foule. For, firſt, there is Diſproportion between the King and the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of an Army, or Commander of a Ship; their Commiſſions are not ſo large as his. Secondly, there is in it a manifeſt <hi>Petitio Principii:</hi> for the Queſtion is, Whether the caſes be like? We deny, they affirme. Thirdly, therein, is <hi>Fallacia dictionis;</hi> for holding of hands, is all that in the Antecedent is preſumed againſt the ſaid General or Pilot; but it is not all that is practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt the King in the Conſequence. Fourthly, bring all into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice which is done againſt the King, under the Allegation of holding his hands, and the Antecedent will be falſe, of the General or Pilot. Fifthly, were there no deceit in the Argument, yet the peremptory Command of GOD the Creator, exempts the Caſe of Kings.</p>
               <p n="17">17. For the firſt; the Commiſſion of the General, and ſo of the Pilot, are given and limited by man, and ſo publikely Triable before man, <hi>in Foro Exteriori:</hi> The Commiſſion of the King is immediately given by GOD, and ſo far as concerneth the Cogniſance of the Subject, unlimited by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who gives Lawes unto his Deputies Conſcience, and will Try him in his proper Court, before Himſelf and his holy Angels, which man may not preſume to doe. The King (for ought that any externall Law of God hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his hands in) can (without any Proceſſe) put to death his General; the General, for the life of every of his Souldiers, is reſponſible to the King, to be openly Tryed, or as the King ſhall appoint. But, put the caſe that a King ſhould iſſue forth a Commiſſion to his General, which ſhould limit his Conſultations and Actions to the pleaſure of his Souldiers; it were too evident, that he had as good have given him no Commiſſion: for amongſt' the many, there will ever be too many, <hi>Qui mallent Juſſa Ducum interpretari,</hi>

               <p>1. FRom what is before ſet down, appears; that <hi>all Power is Gods,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Dominion;</hi> it being his <hi>Prerogative Royal;</hi> in which,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102603:28"/>
all <hi>Powers</hi> of the ſame <hi>Alloy, Originally</hi> are; and from which all that are <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> are by his Grant (upon Record) diſpenſed.</p>
               <p>That no <hi>Titles</hi> thereunto can be ſufficient, without <hi>Gods</hi> particular <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> which way that is already paſſed, by that <hi>God,</hi> who is not double<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tongued, I have proved.</p>
               <p>Alſo [by the largeneſſe of his Patent] whoſe very immediate Power the King hath. That, that muſt be Divine; which is by man unqueſtionable; which cannot be made unjuſt, though unjuſtly uſed: unto which man muſt ſubmit, though it be unjuſtly uſed.</p>
               <p>That in the <hi>Beginning,</hi> both the High Powers (<hi>Regal</hi> and <hi>Sacerdotal</hi>) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended (not by <hi>Virtue</hi> or <hi>Election,</hi> but) by <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Primogeniture;</hi> which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, the Spirit of GOD cals <hi>Miſhpat,</hi> or the <hi>General</hi> and <hi>Juſt Law.</hi> The meane of Conveighance (to be further manifeſted hereafter) I pointed at, to wit, the <hi>Likeneſſe</hi> of <hi>Elohim</hi> and his <hi>Image;</hi> and the different Proportions of their Communication. Alſo, the ſignification of the words <hi>Shuk</hi> and <hi>Maſhal;</hi> in which, by the Law of God (as the Apoſtle calls it) atteſted in the unalterable Goſpel, both the ſaid Powers were decyphered, and mine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation aſſerted.</p>
               <p>That in the Epitome both of the Church and Kingdome, (to wit, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily</hi>) other Forms of Government are intolerable; much more in that wherein the Glory of <hi>Gods Image</hi> is more highly concerned.</p>
               <p>That both the Powers aboveſaid, are <hi>Gods,</hi> and not Mans, by the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which they make upon the Soule, which (upon Earth) hath neither Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nor Lord; but deſcendeth immediately from the <hi>Breath of God;</hi> to whoſe ſole <hi>Regiment</hi> it appertaineth, and can receive <hi>Lawes</hi> from none but <hi>Him.</hi>

               </p>

God firſt reſolves the Regal Power to <hi>Moſes,</hi> to ſhew, that he will have that eſteemed the greater, by the ſaid Firſtneſſe: and afterwards the Sacerdotal to <hi>Aaron,</hi> who was the elder Brother; to ſignifie,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102603:28"/>
that indeed the Prieſthood is of the Elder Houſe; but while we are here on Earth (where that is not firſt which is Spiritual, but that which is Natural) where Dominion was not deſigned for GODS Likeneſſe, but for his Image, (as ſhall be proved) it is to be in ſubjection to the more proper <hi>Power;</hi> in as much as it is Earth (and not Heaven) where (as yet) we enjoy an (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed) abode.</p>

That he is not the Supreme on Earth, who is endowed with this Title, none can juſtifie. That none on Earth hath it againſt him; and that all on Earth, that have any Temporal ſhare thereof, if they have any, muſt have it from, or under him, ſhall be more fully proved, <hi>Chap. 11. Par.</hi> 11. That this Stile is not given to the King, by reaſon of required Sanctity in him (which is the effect of GODS Likeneſſe; not of his Image, by which Dominion comes) is evident by the Spirit of GOD his applying of it to <hi>Heathen Kings</hi> (enemies to the Church of GOD) as well as <hi>Moſes;</hi> who not as <hi>Moſes,</hi> but as <hi>King in Jeſurun,</hi> had this high Privilege.</p>
               <p>10. <hi>Moſes</hi> was Iſraels Law-giver, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 18. So were all the Kings of Judah, <hi>Gen. 49. 10. Moſes,</hi> in all Civil caſes (for the Prieſt was to judge between things Holy and Unholy, Bloud and Bloud, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 8. accordingly <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 7.) was the Ordinary Supreme, and Judge of the Judges; to reſerve Caſes, and to receive Appeals; in whom was the final determination of all Controverſies ariſing from the Judicial Law. So were all the Kings of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, with whom GOD reckoned for the Oppreſſions, and Injuſtice, done by others; as throughout the ſacred ſtory appears. <hi>Moſes,</hi> as he had the Power to <hi>lead the People in,</hi> and in times of Peace to judge them at home; ſo had he the Power of the <hi>Militia,</hi> to <hi>goe out before them,</hi> or to ſend them to Battel: and as of impoſing Taxes; ſo the Power of Life and Death was in his hands.

(Ver. 10.) <hi>Seeke you (without being called of</hi> GOD <hi>as was Aaron) the Prieſts Office alſo?</hi> And Ver. 9. <hi>Seemeth it a ſmall thing to you, that the</hi> GOD <hi>of Iſrael hath ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated you from the multitude of Iſrael, to take you to himſelfe, to doe the ſervice of the Tabernacle of the Lord, and to ſtand before the Congregation to miniſter unto them?

For the which cauſe, both thou and all thy Company are gathered together [againſt the Lord:] and what is Aaron that you murmur againſt him!</hi> And let it be obſerved, that all this was done after <hi>Aaron</hi> had made the golden Calf, which <hi>Korah</hi> durſt not Object; nor againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage againſt the Law.</p>
               <p>18. From whence appears that GOD <hi>Almighty</hi> is violated (of which he is ſenſible eveu unto Jealouſie) when any Power of his Conſtitution is touched but for Alteration; and however the People may be eaſily deluded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that Changing, is bettering, yet GOD juſtly abhors the putting of this diſhonour upon his Wiſdome. That GOD was the Author of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laity,</hi> is aſſured from hence; and ſhall be made more manifeſt when I come to ſpeake of the <hi>Likeneſſe of</hi> GOD. And that he was the diſtinguiſher of the Power of Order, and the Power of Juriſdiction, firſt between the Prieſt and the Levite; ſecondly, between the Prieſts and the Chiefe Prieſts; thirdly, between the High Prieſt, and the Chiefe Prieſts. Anſwerable whereunto (unto which Perpetuity was Promiſed, and Sworn to, as ſhall be proved, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.) was the Prieſthood of the unalterable Evangelical Covenant, Conſtituted, By, and From <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in the <hi>Primitive Church.</hi>

Now when Dominion is any where Eſtabliſhed (as ſhall be made more cleare hereafter) according to the <hi>Heavenly Platforme</hi> (which is copied out in GODS <hi>Word,</hi> as mans perpetual Rule) man ought to tremble at each thought againſt it; as they did who ran away when the Earth (in this Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) opened her mouth. GODS Approbation, being to be preſumed to be no Ieſſe inviolable, where his direction is followed, then if himſelfe, for the Conſtituting of Regal Power, had come amongſt us; whoſe Precept and Example are come into the ſeverall Kingdomes of the one Catholique Church. For Saint <hi>Jude</hi> hath told us, that they doe no better now, then <hi>Korah</hi> did at that time, who ever doe againſt the preſent Powers; what ever they ſhall doe againſt us. And the Power that then was ſupreme, (to wit, of the <hi>Heathen</hi> Roman Emperour) had not the Circumſtantials of that which was conferred upon <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>David:</hi> in whoſe Perſon our Chriſtian Kings were more perfectly Eſtabliſhed, then himſelfe; as ſhall be proved, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.</p>

               <p>22. For my part, (in the ſincerity of a charitable ſoule, I ſay it) I do not ſee how any man can diſtinguiſh any (who go on that way) into any hopes of comfort, while they ſo doe; but, that amongſt Profeſſors of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Reſiſtance of, and Rebellion againſt the lawfull <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Prieſt,</hi> are far more flagitious, then was that againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> For, that their Power, although extraordinarily given; yet when given, it was ordinary: it being the Divine Power of the ſame GOD, for the ſame ends with ours. Thus in <hi>Aaron,</hi> the ſame Power that was in him, was afterwards in <hi>Eledzar;</hi> and is (at the <hi>leaſt</hi>) no <hi>leſſe</hi> in the <hi>Chriſtian Prieſt. 2 Cor. 3. 10. For even that which was made glorious, viz.</hi> the miniſtration of Death, Ver. 7. and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Condemnation, Ver. 9. <hi>had no Glory in this relation; by reaſon</hi> (or with relation to) <hi>of the Glory (viz.</hi> of the miniſtration of the Spirit, Ver. 8.) <hi>that excelleth. For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth is glorious.</hi> So in <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Power of Dominion</hi> was no leſſe in <hi>Joſhua</hi> then in him; and indeed larger in the Jewiſh Kings then either; whoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is exceeded rather then otherwiſe, in the Commiſſion of <hi>Chriſtian Kings;</hi> as ſhall be proved, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>23. Now, ſince the dreadfull Condemnation of <hi>Korah</hi> doth indeed reach down unto theſe dayes; and ſince thoſe Powers which are Divine (though
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102603:32"/>
Executed by mortall men) are themſelves immortall. And ſince the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of GODS everlaſting Name of <hi>Elohim,</hi> and his adding thereunto of his great Seale of Unction, to both the Orders (Regal and Sacerdotal) doth atteſt the everlaſtingneſſe of both the Powers, though the Perſons die. And ſince they were both before the Law, which might Conclude them no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Lawes reputed frailty; but that they muſt end, as (indeed) they did begin, with the world. Yet ſince a multitude of men (led on by thoſe who with moſt applauſe, ſubtily ſtrike at <hi>Moſes</hi> through <hi>Aarons</hi> ſides) who are in themſelves more equall to the <hi>Regal Power,</hi> doe not at all take into their thoughts the poor deſpiſed <hi>Prieſthood;</hi> or if they doe, they thinke it rotten together with <hi>Aarons</hi> in the ſame grave. Let me have leave, onely to lay downe few Grounds, for that, whoſe fuller proofe belongs unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place.</p>
               <p>24. That the Platforme of that Government which ſhould be in the Church on Earth, is ſet us in the Church in Heaven; and the onely Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification thereof in the Book of GOD, is the formal Rule, which all Ages muſt apply themſelves unto: of which, the Legal Inſtitutes were the tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Shadow; the Evangelical, the more ſubſtantial Image; the Celeſtial, the eternal Verity; as <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1. Of which hereafter.</p>
               <p>25. That the Prieſthood of <hi>Aaron</hi> is not Dead but Changed; as theſe our bodies, and the Corn, to multiply the ſame Grain: ſince it was honoured with the Name of <hi>Elohim,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> and withall, with the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity,</hi> in ſundry places of Scriptures. Particularly theſe two laſt conjoyned together, <hi>Num. 18. 8. And againe the Lord ſpake unto Aaron, Behold, I have given thee the keeping of my Offerings, of all the Hallowed things of the Children of Iſrael; I have given them unto thee [for the Anointings ſake,] and to thy Sons, by an [ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Ordinance.</hi>] Since alſo Prieſthood was a Twin of the ſame womb with Regality; Born with the World it ſelf; and went along with the Firſt-born in all Succeſſions; untill GOD thought ſit to ſeparate them, by ſelecting a peculiar Tribe in ſtead of the Firſt-born, <hi>Num.</hi> 3. 45. before which time, it is apparent unto all that is Underſtanding, that they were united; as in the Perſon of <hi>Melchiſedec.</hi>

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102603:32"/>
is no where deſcribed, but in the three Orders of <hi>Aarons</hi> Prieſthood: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to theſe, did our Saviour and his Apoſtles moſt exactly Form the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Triplicity of Biſhop, Prieſt, and Deacon, under the Goſpel; which coming from the Law, and being ratified in the Goſpel, (as ſhall be fully manifeſted) is an evident Argument of its (for ever) Inalterability. And eſpecially, ſince it was done without further precept; it is eaſily viſible, that there needed none: it being a point of moſt high concernment. For, at the Churches Foundation (the Materials being provided) nothing could be ſo neceſſary, as the choyce of Builders, and the Application of them to their ſeverall Taskes; the <hi>Maſter Builder</hi> being the eternall God, one and the ſame for ever; whoſe Ends were the ſame when he built the private Synagogue, which now are for the Catholick Church; whoſe Wiſdom is no elder now then it was at that time: whoſe Workmanſhip (in this particular of theſe three Orders) hath ſtood till this Age throughout all Chriſtendome, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either Renovation or Innovation. Nor did the Primitive Church (ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving at a flouriſhing Subſiſtency) deſigne a new Order, when anſwerable to <hi>Aaron,</hi> who Typified <hi>Chriſt</hi> before he came; they decreed ſemblably to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent him being come, by <hi>Archbiſhops</hi> or <hi>Patriarchs:</hi> which was onely to keep in Order what the Apoſtles had ordered.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THat <hi>Moſes</hi> had <hi>Regal Power,</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi> atteſteth; though not ſo large (while <hi>God</hi> immediately exerciſed his own Power, by his own ſelf; iſſuing from himſelfe, his Imperial <hi>Edicts,</hi> and receiving <hi>Appeales</hi>) as upon the withdrawing of himſelfe, he made over to <hi>Kings,</hi> for avoyding the violations of his own <hi>Sanctimony;</hi> and giving ungovernable man reſpite of bethinking himſelf; till Himſelf ſhould come to Judge both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Them.</hi> In the meane time, while he performed that Royal part himſelfe, (as pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Monarchs doe from his Example) he gave no <hi>Commiſſions,</hi> but during <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Pleaſure;</hi> and never entruſted the Multitude, but ever one man with the Charge of his Authority; and perpetually (<hi>as a King</hi>) had the choyce of his own <hi>Officers.</hi> Thus it was during the time of the <hi>Judges;</hi> whoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment (though Monarchical, <hi>God</hi> never enſtamping his <hi>Image</hi> upon a Plate of many pieces) yet being but for terme of life, appertaineth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to this Diſpute in this place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Patterne he ſet unto <hi>Kings,</hi> for the after-times of his Receding from the immediate Adminiſtration of his <hi>Regality;</hi> as he was forthwith enforced even from the Beginning of the World, in mercifull Compaſſion of the generall unfitneſſe of mankind, to endure the Purity of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty over them in all the reſt of the Nations: yet ſo, as when he ſhould
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102603:34"/>
Divolve and Entail his Authority, (which he never left Elective) he would himſelfe make choice of the Stock, upon which he would Engraffe his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall Authority; to teach all thoſe (for ever) who will call themſelves by his Name, or be accounted his People, that Primogeniture is his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way of Election, which he hath promiſed under Chriſtianity ſhall not faile, (as will appeare, <hi>Chapters</hi> 8. and 9.) Thus it was Conſtituted from the Beginning, and Mankind was not to diſturb it, unleſſe he ſent his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Commiſſion. It was at the firſt placed in <hi>Adam,</hi> deſigned unto <hi>Kain,</hi> (as the extent of the words before handled, doe demonſtrate) and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards (in the Ordinary courſe) to deſcend to the <hi>Firſt-born,</hi> by the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and Univerſall Law of Nature, (to wit, <hi>Miſhpat</hi>) as <hi>Deut. 21. 17. For he is the firſt of his ſtrength,</hi> (as having the Tide of the <hi>ſtrong God,) and</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>the Right of the Firſt-born is his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This is the Doctrine of the Scriptures, in this great Point: they that will doe otherwiſe, muſt look otherwiſe to Juſtifie it, then by the Word of God; which, I dare not admit a thought, that all Mankind may preſume. I ſhall therefore paſſe over the time of the Judges, who were as high Stewards unto him the King; while for about foure hundred yeares he was in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kings, and alſo all thoſe, who for ever will be his People, that the Kingſhip, which in Mercy he would afterwards ſettle, in, and over Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, ſhould be and remaine for ever his own; notwithſtanding, that for the Ends diſplayed in the laſt Chapter, he was content to recede from the immediate Exerciſe of that which was his, and no ones elſe; and of our own Bone and Fleſh, to eſtabliſh in his own place, thoſe who might moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently Adminiſter his Power.</p>
               <p n="4">4. So that now I come to Treat of that ſetled Forme of Government, which <hi>God</hi> (who onely hath Right to diſpoſe of that which is ſo peculiarly his own) Eſtabliſhed for ever amongſt his owne People; and that was Juſt, and perfect Monarchy. Of which onely (and of no other Form any where, or at any time) he was Author; (the Reaſon will come to our hands here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after)<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.</note> and this, when by Lot he choſe out <hi>Saul</hi> from all the Families of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, upon the Petition of the People unto <hi>Samuel, 1 Sam.</hi> 8. 5.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The ſinfulneſſe of which Petition, men much miſtake: it lay not in the <hi>Quid,</hi> or <hi>Matter</hi> of it, (according to that of <hi>Deut. 18. 17. The Lord ſaid, They have well ſpoken, in all that they have ſpoken:</hi>) but it lay firſt in the <hi>Quando,</hi> the circumſtance of time, when it was deſired; which ſince the times of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> could never have been ſo wretched: for during the meane ſpace, no man had done, or could adminiſter the place of <hi>God,</hi> with greater Prudence, Uprightneſſe, and Succeſſe, then <hi>Samuel</hi> had done it. But their grave Pretexts of their fooliſh <hi>Feares</hi> and <hi>Jealouſies,</hi> when they had ſuch a <hi>Prince</hi> whom Envy it ſelfe could not diſtaine; when they ought rather to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102603:35"/>
have gone beſide themſelves with Dutifull Gratitude, then with Scandalous Providence; was that, which was a prime part of the ſin of their Petition.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Secondly, adde unto this Circumſtance the perſonall Frowardneſſe (more or leſſe) of each of mankind, againſt being Governed; which at that time <hi>Epidemically</hi> poſſeſſed the whole multitude of Iſrael.

Fourthly, he (who may chuſe his owne Officers) hath in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular diſpoſed of this his Prerogative over the People, unto Kings; and hath communicated unto them of his Spirit, and unto Inferior Magiſtrates of their Regal Spirits: as, <hi>Iſa. 28. 5, 6.

               <p n="29">29. So it was Propheſied of before hand, for good <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and his Princes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32. 1. So in the Benedictive Prayer of King <hi>David</hi> for his Son <hi>Solomon;</hi> whom (by GODS direction) he deſigned his Succeſſor, <hi>Pſal. 72. 1. Give thy Miſhpats, Oh Elohim, unto the King; and thy Juſtice unto the Kings Son: and ſo in Juſtice he ſhall judge thy People, and deliver the Afflicted in Miſhpat.

I deſire not to recount, but rather that others would uſe their own eyes, and ſadly examine by thoſe which are there expreſſed, the pretended Uſurpations, which have coſt ſo much Bloud among us. But
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:102603:38"/>
here miſtake me not, as if I went about to make a colour, that what the Prince may doe in caſe of Neceſſity, he may doe at pleaſure: where the King onely againſt the People, not againſt GOD, is made Judge of his own <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities,</hi> when to make uſe of his Subjects <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Eſtates;</hi> which they may not with-hold or withdraw, when he calls for them. As upon perill of <hi>Elohims</hi> high diſpleaſure, he may not call for them, but when indeed he hath need of them; nor make uſe of them, but as he will be accountable to <hi>his King;</hi> who hath Power over him, as he hath over the People.

               <p n="33">33. So is here ſet down, not what <hi>Saul</hi> may do by GOD unpuniſhed; but what he may do, by man unreſiſted: for GOD, who will not endure his own Power in the <hi>King</hi> to be <hi>Queſtioned,</hi> becauſe it is His; will (becauſe it is His) much leſſe endure, that his Power (as unjuſtly uſed) ſhould deſerve to be <hi>Queſtioned.</hi> And GOD (who is never unjuſt, when his Deputy may be) will be ſharper in his Returnes unto the <hi>King,</hi> then the <hi>King</hi> can be in his Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions over his People; but he will in no caſe abide the People to Judge his Power: of whoſe <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> his ſecret Prerogative it is to diſcerne, when to doe good, by good or bad Princes. For People may be ſo bad, that good Kings (whom they deſerve not) may make them worſe, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires not; they can never be ſo good, but wicked Kings may burne out their droſſe, and make them better: which is the chief aime of him who is Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it ſelfe.</p>

               <p n="48">48.

And the Spirit of GOD it was, who recorded this Expreſſion for us.</p>
               <p n="50">50. And this I may be bold to conceive, that <hi>David</hi> knew the cauſes why <hi>Saul</hi> was Repudiated; and other his Miſcarriages, which were not done in a corner: but <hi>David</hi> had ſo much <hi>Religion,</hi> (I might ſay <hi>Chriſtianity</hi>) as not to diſcover, though in his Perſecuter, the ſpots of that Skin, whereupon the <hi>Lords Oyle</hi> had been powred; much leſſe durſt he caſt dirt upon that <hi>Oyle.</hi> Whereas (with willing Piety) he recorded his Vertues for all Generations, and left GOD (his King) to doe the other.

Onely give me leave (with due acknowledgements of Honour, and particularly towards the <hi>Author</hi> of that moſt Chriſtian Tract againſt <hi>Reſiſtance of the Lawfull Magiſtrate,</hi>) briefly to interpoſe this my <hi>Levis Armatura,</hi> before ever the matter come, either <hi>ad Triarios,</hi> or <hi>ad Principes.</hi> By whom it hath been Invincibly Eſtabliſhed, that if the Reſiſtance in Queſtion had been tolerable in former times; yet now by <hi>Chriſt</hi> (under <hi>Chriſtianity</hi>) it is declared damnable.</p>
               <p n="52">52. It is well knowne, that <hi>David</hi> from the <hi>Lord,</hi> was by the <hi>Lords Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Anointed</hi> ſor that Kingdome; and ſo had GODS Title (if that be worth any thing) unto the ſame: as alſo, that <hi>Saul</hi> was from the mouth of GOD rejected, and ſo had it not. And yet <hi>David</hi> preſumed not to goe about his Depoſition, or to take away his life, when it was in his power. Whereas <hi>Jehu</hi> (with the approbation of GOD) ſo ſoon as he was <hi>Anointed,</hi> made haſt, and marched fiercely to the Depoſition and Death of <hi>Joram, 2 King</hi> 9. 13.

                  <head>The Concluſion.</head>
                  <p>Now (for Concluſion hereof) to ſumme up what hath been delivered in this larger Diſcourſe; wherein is ſet forth GODS faire Impreſſion, of what was in his ſhort written Copy from the Beginning of the World, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Power of Dominion: whereof, this (conſtituted by himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the former Iſrael of GOD) was but an Exemplification, not an Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raion of what was in the Beginning; and therefore, (without his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition) muſt continue unto the End.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wherein is Declared:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">Firſt, that the <hi>Petition</hi> of his People <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for a <hi>King,</hi> was not <hi>ſinfull in its Nature, but Circumſtance;</hi> in as much as the Prayer of the Petition, was by GODS Providence predetermined: and the <hi>Rules</hi> thereof deſcribed, <hi>Deut. 17. 54. When thou art come into the Land, which the Lord thy God hath given thee; and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:102603:41"/>
wilt</hi> (that is, thou mayeſt if thou wilt) <hi>ſet a King over thee, [like all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are about thee.</hi>] Which is, though thou be my peculiar People, yet in this particular, (I having thus Conſtituted from the Beginning, and Bowed all the Nations of the World to Submit unto this Law of Nature and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon derived from Above) there ſhall be no difference between them and thee; onely, thou (who haſt reaſon to know whoſe the Power of Dominion is, better then they) <hi>Shalt in no wiſe preſume to chuſe my Deputy;</hi> as it is, Verſe. 15. And accordingly, they beſpoke <hi>Samuel to make them a King, like all the Nations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That in this <hi>Apogaeum,</hi> or Retreat of GOD, from the more immediate Exerciſe of his owne Dominion, to have a <hi>King</hi> (as his Publike <hi>Image</hi>) to Suſtaine his Power and Repreſent his Glory; is on Earth the moſt Heavenly Gift, which GOD can give, or Man receive: promiſed unto <hi>Abraham</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law) as his grand Bleſſing, and in Him to all the Heires of Bleſſing. Whence, and in regard of the Repreſented, <hi>The King is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſis Major,</hi> and of more value then all the People, and all theirs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the Univerſall and Eternall; High and Holy; Prudent and Juſt Prerogative of GOD, is over all, whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath Redeemed, or <hi>Elohim</hi> Created. Whether converſant above Lawes, and their Enacting, their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting, or Suſpending; Continuing or Abrogating: or concerning Perſons and their Functions; whether Eccleſiaſticall or Civill; Superior, or Inferior: and the Regulating of them in their ſeverall Orders and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; for Peace, or War; for Life, or Death: or in relation to things, Holy, or Common; Publike, or Private; in Heaven, or Earth: or concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Seaſons; when to goe the ordinary way, when to uſe his Prerogative; when this is convenient; when neceſſary; when neither: for all times, and time it ſelfe: for Continuing or Shortning; Hallowing, or leaving Free thereof for ever. All theſe are included for GOD, in the <hi>Longitude</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> of the great Globe of the word <hi>Miſhpat,</hi> aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That (for the Regulating of this World) in the Communication of this word of Prerogative to Kings, is imparted (proportionably) the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power on Earth, in all Cauſes; and the onely Power in all Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Cauſes. In which Power, no man, or men have ſhare; but as it is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the <hi>King;</hi> as the <hi>Kings</hi> is from GOD: who never gave Authority to the People to intermeddle with any thing that is his <hi>Peculiar;</hi> which if it belong to any but One, cannot be <hi>Prerogative Royal.</hi> If it belong to the People, then hath GOD on Earth no Subjects.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That the true underſtanding of the word <hi>Miſhpat,</hi> muſt be fetched from the Scriptures, and the ſeverall places wherein it is uſed. That Error about it is dangerous; and the frequent Interpretations given of it in theſe Dayes, are Erroneous.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That the Names of <hi>Elohim</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Communicated indifferently to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102603:42"/>
all <hi>Chriſtian Kings,</hi> (they having alſo the Title of the <hi>Lords Anointed,</hi> upon whom the Ceremony is not uſed) doe Atteſt together with the word <hi>Miſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pat,</hi> whoſe Power they have; both for <hi>Perpetuity</hi> and <hi>Intangibility,</hi> both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokened in the <hi>Holy Oyle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. That it is moſt juſt, that he that is moſt Juſt, ſhould be at Liberty for the Exerciſe of his Juſtice; and that he that is moſt Wiſe, ſhould not have his Wiſdome bounded by fond Man: and He who is altogether Good, by thoſe who are altogether Evill; but that he ſhould be left free to Glorifie himſelf, by bringing Good out of Evill: and when in his Wiſdome he thinks good, to doe good by good meanes: or to puniſh a wicked People by a wicked King, when it concerneth his Juſtice. Since to thoſe who are his, he can doe as great good, by the bad, as by the good; and the bad are ordinarily made worſe by the goodneſſe of their <hi>Princes;</hi> and as ordinarily the beſt <hi>Kings</hi> are the worſt uſed. Therefore, he neither will, nor may truſt man to <hi>Queſtion</hi> any; for then either from the Good or from the Bad, none would be endured. But in Concluſion, he will make all to find, that he hath beene moſt Juſt; and them in the firſt place, who have Abuſed the Power he gave them; or Uſurped the Power he gave them not.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That it is one of GODS <hi>Secrets,</hi> (above humane Inquiſition) for what Ends he ſetteth up him that will be a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> in his owne place: it is of his <hi>Revealed Will,</hi> that none in that place ſhould be Reſiſted; for whoſe Lives and Happineſſe, all are bound (for ever) to pray, though they be their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſecuters.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. That unto the King belongeth the Power of the <hi>Militia;</hi> Power over the Subjects goods, in caſe of neceſſity, whereof the King (with relation to the People) is ſole Judge. Power of Impoſition of Taxes, and granting of Free Charter: Power of Commanding in the Duties of Religion: Power of enjoyning Publike Covenants and Oathes Obligatory for all the People, even him that is Heire of the Crowne. And incluſively, in or with theſe, all other the Points in Queſtion now amongſt us, concerning <hi>Regality.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. That to undervalue Life and Livelihood, that we may follow and ſerve Him, whom GOD hath Conſtituted over us, is an Act of <hi>Religious Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation:</hi> and is an evidence that we are the <hi>Sons of God;</hi> whereas valuing our <hi>Oxen,</hi> and deſpiſing the <hi>King,</hi> is a token of the <hi>Children of Satan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. That neglect of Office and Truſt repoſed by the <hi>King,</hi> much more Diſobedience (when GOD his onely Supreme, commandeth not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,) and Reſiſtance, (which God hath commanded againſt) and Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which God hath profeſſed himſelfe to abhorre; deſerveth death though in the greateſt of Subjects. The leaſt of thoſe: therefore certainly the greateſt.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. That the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> hath aſcribed the Proſperity of his People, and the Plenty which they enjoyed, to him who was a <hi>Tyrant;</hi> whom himſelfe
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102603:42"/>
juſtly deſtroyed, to ſhow that Gods Power cannot but be beneficiall; and hath recorded this acknowledgement by Him, who of all men living was moſt injured by the <hi>Tyrant;</hi> to teach us, that all men are bound to Celebrate the Vertues (though) of ſuch; and that no man may ſo much as <hi>Libell</hi> their <hi>Vices.</hi>

                     <p>A Digreſsion in Anſwer to the Queſtion, How a man may know whether his Prince be (indeed) the Lords Anointed. Certaine Praecognoſcenda for the manifeſtation thereof. The three-fold Acts and Donation of the three Perſons of the Trinity, conveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeverall Rights to man. Of Title to, Title in, and Help from the Creature. Conſiderations from Mans inability to command that which is his owne, to nouriſh him. No Evidence produced from him who is the Heir of all things, for the People to Aſsiſe mens Severalties. <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency had not Original Right ſo much as to Hearbs and Fruits; much leſſe can his ſinfull Children have naturall Propriety (without Donation) in other the things which God (not they) Created.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">1. THe next particular in my propoſed Method, is, the Entaile of the Name and Power of the Creator, for the Government and Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Creature; wherein <hi>Elohim</hi> (in his furtheſt Receſſe from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Adminiſtration of his own <hi>unacquittable Dominion</hi>) loſeth nothing of his for ever Juſt <hi>Soveraignty;</hi> but gaineth the eſtabliſhment of it from falſe Chriſts, whom he hath not <hi>Anointed:</hi> and therefore, man may not goe out to ſeek <hi>Here</hi> or <hi>There</hi> in the <hi>Wilderneſſe</hi> of Pretending Spirits, when (once for all) he hath ſetled his <hi>owne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This he did (exemplarily for his greater Church of the Gentiles) when he ſettled his Title in <hi>David</hi> and his Seed for ever, according to the Law of Nature or Nations: yet (as the ſequell will make evident) transferred no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from himſelf. And for this cauſe (of which, till further manifeſtation, I beſpeake your patience) he reſolves (at firſt) not to goe the ordinary way, according to the Rule of Primogeniture; but to let all Ages know, that the <hi>Royalty</hi> ſtill remained His, though given to <hi>David</hi> by a <hi>Covenant of Salt:</hi> he will rather breake his owne <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall Law</hi> (though by himſelfe fortified with ſtrong Reaſons, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 17. and founded upon greater, elſewhere
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102603:45"/>
Expreſſed) for the Inheritance of the <hi>Firſt-born;</hi> then that it ſhould not be underſtood, that he gave away nothing from himſelfe, when (from all others) he gave the Kingdome to <hi>David</hi> and his Poſterity. That Law muſt (therefore) once more ſuffer violence; and the Younger (to wit, <hi>Solomon</hi>) muſt inherit: and then for ever, he intends the Ordinary way, leaving no warranty for Humane boldneſſe to adventure otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But (not taking in more into this particular, then I ſhall prove to have been in <hi>David</hi> and his <hi>Line</hi>) I ſhall <hi>here</hi> make my promiſed <hi>Digreſſion;</hi> which is but to bring it a little before its time, for the more haſty ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe, who deſire to know, <hi>How they may be aſſured, that the preſent Prince is inveſted with the Right of Gods Power; and (as the Lords Chriſt) by Gods effectuall <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction taken from amongſt all other men, and Dignified with the Lords Supreme Earthly Soveraignty, for the managing of his Irreſiſtible Sword and Scepter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. And (here) I firſt premiſe, that in all places of <hi>Elohims</hi> Creation, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath unqueſtionable and Irreſiſtible <hi>Dominion;</hi> and doth whatſoever he pleaſeth in Heaven, in Earth, in the Sea, and in all deep places; that is, in Hell in ſelfe, and in all other places of Hels conformity: but requireth more regular and perfect Obedience from Chriſtians. (the ſons of Light and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) then from others the Children of Darkneſſe and Confuſion: amongſt whom, without any Covenant of Grace, all things are diſpoſed by their Luſts, and againſt their intentions; yet ever according to his will, though not of his good pleaſure, yet of his juſt anger: and they doe him ſervice, and are in his ſubjection, though not as in his Houſe, yet as in his Priſon. From thoſe that will be of his houſhold, he expecteth their Order, as well as their Worke; and Obedience in both, or elſe no Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Concerning the Queſtion, I anſwer, <hi>That it behoveth them who <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>make ſuch Queſtions, That we can prove the Kings Title from God; otherwiſe they ſhall never be able to prove their owne, for thoſe Eſtates which confidently they call their owne.</hi> For (after the Kings and Prieſts Patrimonies were deſcribed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 45. 8.) God had (certainly) ſome meaning in thoſe words; <hi>And the reſt of the Land, ſhall they</hi> (viz. the Princes) <hi>give unto the Houſe of Iſrael.</hi> So that firſt (<hi>ad Hominem</hi>) I returne, <hi>that by the ſame way,</hi> (though otherwiſe alſo, and with Magiſterial demonſtration) <hi>a man may know the Royall Rights of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nqueſtionable, and Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible Supremacy, to be his particular Princes; by which he knoweth, his juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended Fſtate to be his owne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. In which particular, it concernes him to be well aſſured, that he is not an Uſurper of that, which (here) for a moment ſuſtaines him; but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him (otherwiſe) eternally: and that without Gods Secondary Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation (added to his firſt and generall Grant of the Dominion of the whole Earth to mankind) the Eſtate (he ſaith) he is Maſter of, is no more his, then it is other mens. This he hath performed to all thoſe who are Children of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102603:45"/>
his Houſe, and Subjects of his Kingdome; though by himſelfe he hath mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured out no mans Specialties, nor given him leave to take what he can get. Nor (in the third place) is any man ſo the <hi>Dominus,</hi> that he hath the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of any part of <hi>Elohims</hi> Creation, by his firſt and generall Grant; or by his Secondary Gift, that without his third, of <hi>ſingular Application,</hi> he can with due and comfortable ſecurity make uſe of, and take benefit by (ſo much as of) one morſell of his owne bread.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Theſe three Acts of God, anſwering unto the three Perſons of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> (operating more nobly about our Spiritualties) in the habitude which man receives from them, may not inconveniently be expreſſed by that of the Schooles; <hi>Jus ad rem, Jus in re,</hi> and <hi>Jus</hi> (or rather <hi>Adjus,</hi> or <hi>Adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum) rei.</hi> The firſt containes Mans Right <hi>from God:</hi> the ſecond, his Right <hi>from other men:</hi> the third, his Right <hi>for himſelfe.</hi> The firſt was of the general Indulgent <hi>Father</hi> (both of our Bodies and Soules) the generall Gift of Right <hi>unto the Earth</hi> and the Emoluments thereof, immediately from the Creation and Floud. The ſecond is <hi>from Chriſt,</hi> (the Heire of all things in Heaven and Earth) by whom our Perſonall Conditions are ſeveralized; and by whoſe Deputies, our Perſonall Eſtates are mounded from all others the men of the world: this is daily adminiſtred through the Government by him on Earth Eſtabliſhed, which gives and protects unto us, Right <hi>in the Creature.</hi> The third, is his moſt particular or ſingular Gift of Suſtentation from his other Gifts; the Act of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> by whoſe operation we have our Nutritive and Conſolatory Preſervation (being ſupported Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally here, as a pledge of Eternity hereafter.) And this may be called the Right of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> and <hi>Help from the Creature:</hi> without which, neither can our owne Bread feed us, nor our cloathes keep us warme.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The ſecond is, that wherein the Controverſie lieth; and therefore, I chuſe to ſpeak laſt of that. The laſt is that, which (duly conſidered) would make ſmooth the Lords way before us for the other; and erect in us, not onely Chriſtian content therewith, but alſo excite our moſt thankfull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of <hi>Gods</hi> moſt gracious Providence therein; which ſhould be as often as our hand goeth to our mouthes with any of his bleſſings in this kind. And therefore, I ſhall firſt ſpeake briefly of the laſt.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The evidence of this, is beſt learnt from that which <hi>our Saviour</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted (apparently) for our daily Prayer and Meditation, in that he fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it for that which we have daily need of; to wit, our daily Bread: <hi>Give us this day our daily Bread.</hi> Firſt, <hi>Give</hi> thou it to us, or elſe it can never be <hi>Ours.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Give</hi> it us, although it be already <hi>Ours:</hi> though it be ſo <hi>Ours,</hi> that no man elſe can have Title to it; yet it can never be ſo <hi>Ours,</hi> but he ſhall have daily Intereſt (which he will have <hi>daily</hi> acknowledged) in the leaſt Crum thereof. Though he hath <hi>given</hi> it us into our Barnes and Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, yet there are <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> there are <hi>Sabeans,</hi> and there is the <hi>Fire of God.</hi>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:102603:46"/>
Though he hath given it us into our Diſh: yet <hi>Multa cadunt,</hi> many things fall our between the Cup and the Lip: though into our Stomacks, yet it may be vomited up again: though into the Liver, yet even there (to our deſtruction) it may nouriſh a diſeaſe in ſtead of us: yea, the very ſtrength it affordeth us, may be unto us an occaſion of falling.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. So that every man hath need, and buſineſſe enough, to make ſure of his owne Title unto that which he deſires ſo to enjoy, that he may reap be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and not ruine by it; and not be inquiſitive about his Brothers: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that which he who (certainly) was <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſis major,</hi> ſaid in that caſe, Who made me a Judge? And upon the remembrance hereof to looke into the Book of God, what wayes he expects mans ſubſtance and ſtrength ſhould be employed. And eſpecially to take heed of ſuch Queſtions, as caſt God out from Reigning over us; from whoſe Dominion conſtituted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, our Secondary Titles are derived, as our Firſt was of his Donation.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. By our Inability then of making comfortable uſe of thoſe things which are come under our hands, (if we would not have them accurſed to us) we are neceſſitated ſadly to conſider, that we cannot enjoy any thing againſt God, but muſt under him: and nothing under him, but by his more particular (added to his generall) Donation; and nothing otherwiſe, then under the Government of his Vicegerent, by any expreſſe Donation of his; he hath left that to his Steward; whom (or none) he hath made Judge and Almoner in his roome for this end. So that without he ſhould come him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, no Evidence can be made of this his Gift in ſeverall, from the Intereſts of other men: and no man may invade this his Prerogative, wherein he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did otherwiſe diſpoſe, (this therefore mankind may not preſume) whoſe Prerogative onely, can make and queſtion his own Deputies; whom to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make, is to make God none of our God; and whom to queſtion, is indeed to forfeit our Secondary Title.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. For if we have any ſuch Right to any thing on Earth, we have it by and under him, from whom we have our Firſt and Third Title: of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, we can have no other aſſurance, then through him, whom <hi>Elohim</hi> in Heaven, hath made <hi>Elohim</hi> on Earth. Of whom God hath ſaid, That it is he who cloatheth the Rich with their own Scarlet; from whom the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous have their Ornaments of Gold; and thoſe that are well Fed, their Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies, <note n="*" place="margin">Which is the Reaſon of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of the King, when we ſay Grace for our Meat; and of the Catholique Church, which cannot but teach us thankefull Obedience for it; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The fore-mentioned Queſtion Anſwered. Every mans aſſurance from God, of his owne Title to his owne Eſtate; aſſerteth the Kings.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102603:47"/>
The Subjects Right dependeth on the Kings. Humane Lawes (as Humane) cannot give away Gods Title to any man. Humane Lawes, as enlivened by the Divine Power of the King, can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe Propriety unto each man. None but the King hath Gods warranty (in his revealed Will) as his Steward, to ſet forth mans Severalties.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">1. NOw concerning the <hi>Kings</hi> Title in Queſtion; every conſcientious Subject, in Juſtifying of his owne, muſt alſo Aſſert his. The <hi>Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> being put to him, <hi>How he can maintaine the Estate he holdeth, to be his owne?</hi> He makes no doubt but to ſatisfie any rationall man, that it came to him thus, and thus derived; either by juſt Deſcent, or elſe by Gift, or Purchaſe, from thoſe who had that Right thereunto: and if it hath quietly and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily paſſed the third and fourth Generation, he that hath read the <hi>ſecond Commandement,</hi> will be ready to yeeld him <hi>Gods</hi> approbation for it. But if it be made evident, that no good Title can be produced againſt it, or that it hath ſo continued time out of mind without apparent Uſurpation; the Religious man will goe along with him in his Concluſion, that he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Gods Title to it; and that <hi>Elohim's</hi> Donation is violated by any that moleſts him in it. And hitherto, the Kings Title ſtands upon as firme a Foundation, as any of his Subjects.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But if we trace the Subjects Title up to the height, we may (perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture) finde it the Donation of ſuch or ſuch a King: and here the King hath the better, his Subjects Rights depending upon his. But if any man will be contentious, the <hi>Finall Determination</hi> is conceived to be in the Law.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But againe, it is cleare, that the Lawes of Man cannot oblige God, nor give away his Title; they may tie other mens hands from medling, but they cannot ſatisfie Conſcience: That what is bound on Earth, is bound in Heaven; without warranty deſcended thence, they can neither make God to impart his Title; nor hinder him from diſpoſing of it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: it muſt rather be the Law and Covenant of God, that muſt Determine and Aſſure this. But here it cannot be expected, that the caſe of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man ſhould be ſet downe in Scripture; for then the world could not containe the Books: nor can it be deſerved, that the Fabrick of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Kingdome, ſhould with ſeverall Punctilio's be deſcribed by <hi>Elohim.</hi> He who hath Power over his Clay, hath conſtituted his Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which all men may take notice of; and but one throughout the whole world; which if men will not take notice of, they may at their own perils, miſcarry by their owne dangerous Wiſdomes.</p>

                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:102603:47"/>4. For thoſe, who make Heaven their aime, (as ſhall be made evident when I come to ſpeake of the Lords Prayer) he hath decyphered that Form, by which Himſelfe adminiſtreth Heaven; and expreſſed it in his heavenly Word, which he hath left for mans venerable and perpetuall Rule, till he come from Earth to Heaven. And ſince man cannot expect, that particular Mens, or Kingdomes, Rights and Homages, ſhould be expreſly in it; he may not but underſtand, that <hi>God</hi> expects, they ſhould be according to it; and as indulged, ſo paid. In this Point therefore, concerning the Conveighance of Gods Title to private men, How readeſt thou? Are the People in Gods Throne? or the King? Is his Scepter committed to them? Or is he the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver? Herein the King hath the Better alſo.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Againe, ſince <hi>Adam</hi> during his Innocency (in whom alone was all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Power; and more then all his Poſterity now have) had not in himſelf Originally, the Dominion over Herbs and Fruits, which God made pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to ſerve him; though from the ſame womb whence he was taken: How come Humane Lawes to have the diſpoſall, not onely over theſe, but greater matters? Yea, of Man himſelfe! His Liberty or Reſtraint! His life or Death! This Power is evidently Divine. And as evident it is, that no Divine Power can be taken by man, but if he have it, it muſt be given him from Above. And no leſſe it is, that <hi>Elohim</hi> hath Dominion in all parts and places of his Creation: and where he hath not Regular and Voluntary, he will have Correptive and Irreſiſtible Soveraignty. Direction and Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, every where are his, and onely his.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. How come we then to have this confidence, that our Nationall Laws ſhould have this his Power amongſt us? May we expect? Doe we deſerve? Or dare we endure? That GOD ſhould at all turnes come down amongſt us! (as he did in <hi>Sinai,</hi> which cauſed <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe to quake and tremble) to animate our Conſultations! and give being to our Devices! Look we again into the Booke of GOD, and there we ſhall finde, that the Prince is left in GODS ſtead to doe this; leſt the terrours of GOS <hi>Majeſty</hi> (as ſhall be ſhewed) ſhould in this caſe confound his People.

The Publike Father hood of the King, proved from <hi>Gen. 9. 5.</hi> A Repetition of ſome Paſſages elſewhere Juſtified.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">1. WEll, through the King, and by your Obedience to him, you have GODS <hi>Right</hi> to your Temporall Eſtates: <hi>Queſtion</hi> not that Title, whoſe very <hi>Queſtioning</hi> extinguiſheth yours. You muſt know that yours are forfeitable; and <hi>Diſobedience</hi> is the thing, which GOD from the Beginning hath forewarned would doe it. And not onely that Title, which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of GOD'S <hi>Image</hi> you have to the Earth; but alſo that, which in regard of his <hi>Likeneſſe,</hi> you have to Heaven. The firſt and greateſt Conſiderables in GODS Law, demonſtrate the ſame. In either of the Tables, the firſt thing that GOD provided for, was the eſtabliſhment of Soveraignty, for the Praiſe and Bleſſing of thoſe that doe well, and the Puniſhment of Offenders; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he nominated the Offences, decreed for Puniſhment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the firſt <hi>Table,</hi> (whoſe Principall Object is the Reſtauration of GODS <hi>Likeneſſe</hi>) He firſt declareth for his owne Authority: <hi>I am Jehovah, Elohim</hi> the Eternall Beginning of thine Eternity; thy Creator in the Beginning of time, who onely have Power to give thee Lawes, to Governe thee all thy time. Thou ſhalt acknowledge no other <hi>Elohim</hi> (or <hi>Supreme Power,</hi> for the Governance of that which I Created) but Me: and then deſcends to the particulars of his Worſhip and Service.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the ſecond Table, firſt, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother;</hi> and then, <hi>Thou
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102603:48"/>
ſhalt not Kill: Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery,</hi> &amp;c. To teach all Generations, that Obedience, is to be preferred before Life, Honour, and Livelihood: and that in the Paternity, which is the Object of this Commandement, was Eſtabliſhed the ſecurity of Life, Honour, and Livelihood. And, that leſt there ſhould be Killing, GOD hath given Power to Kill, unto the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Exerciſer of his moſt juſt and true Paternity, over all his Children; with which Power, he that is but mans, <hi>Brother,</hi> may not for ever intermeddle. And he that is in GODS Place the Generall Father, muſt (for the Ends, for which GOD hath placed him there) have Divine Power, ſemblable to thoſe Ends; to wit, the <hi>Scepter</hi> and <hi>Sword</hi> of <hi>Elohim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. But without the Power of the Sword, the Scepter of GOD himſelfe, barely Commanding, would be but coldly Obeyed: and for this cauſe, He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſecure unto GOD the Worſhip of the firſt Table, GOD will be the more ſevere exactor of the Homages of the ſecond Table for him. And therefore, particular and ſundry inconveniencies may fall out, and muſt be endured: but for the generall, GOD is our <hi>Father,</hi> (and beſides Him and His, none ought to be ſo called) whileſt his Prerogative, and our Allegiance is in this unſhaken. But if that whereon our Obedience to all the reſt is founded, come to be ruined; the other cannot ſtand (on high-lone) in the Aire.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And for this cauſe (though GOD hath barely told him his duty to him in his Word, particularly what he expecteth from him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.) the Lord hath not tyed up his hands (as hath been ſhewed, and particularly for what concerneth the Subject, is legible, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 11. &amp;c.) with a Niggard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Reſiſtible Commiſſion, for then they could not be at liberty to doe that good, which particular and daily Exigencies will require. But he is by GOD left unto the generall good Nature of the word <hi>Father;</hi> whoſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, all other Fathers are: other Magiſtrates being his Lievtenants, He im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately GODS: they Execute his Power; He the <hi>Lord of Hoſts:</hi> they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count unto Him; He unto GOD.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And here, I could wiſh from my ſoule, that we loved our Temporall Eſtates, Better, that is, more prudently then we doe: for as by our diſunion with <hi>Chriſt</hi> from Heaven, we forfeit our Intereſt in Heaven; ſo by our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union with our Earthly <hi>Chriſts,</hi> (however we may ſpeed here for a time) we extinguiſh (at the leaſt) our juſt Title to the Earth. For it is, <hi>Honour thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and thy Mother, that thy dayes may be long in the Land, which Jehovah Elohim hath given thee.</hi> Whileſt we are under the Covert but of our private Parents, who in compariſon of the <hi>King</hi> beare not the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Elohim</hi> over us, (as hath bin ſhewed, and will more fully appear) by our Diſobedience unto them; that which we were borne unto, lookes backe againe unto them, for their better diſpoſall of it: ſo by our Diſobedience unto him, whom GOD hath ſtated in the Right of his <hi>Paternity,</hi> our Eſtates returne unto the <hi>Father</hi> of our Countrey. Which Sin, from the place that the Commandement hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102603:49"/>
amongſt the reſt, may be concluded worſe then the ſin of Murder, and its fellowes; as on the contrary, that Obedience is to be preferred before Livelihood, Honour, and Life it ſelfe: that we are bound to loſe all, that we may keep it; which (by Divines) is juſtly celebrated for the moſt noble of all Morall Vertues; Inferiour onely, and next unto the three Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call; Faith, Hope, and Charity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in as much as it ſacreth and ſecureth all the reſt of the Commandements of GOD, being the <hi>Arſenall,</hi> and middle <hi>Tower</hi> thereof.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And here, I ſhall not miſ-ſpend any ones time againſt thoſe, who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not the <hi>Kings Prerogative</hi> in this Commandement, make but nine; for the tenth and moſt conſiderable part of mankind, who have on Earth no other Parents; or ſpuriouſly make the People their owne Fathers. Give me leave to looke backe unto the forecited, <hi>Gen. 9. 5, 6. At the hand of every Mans Brother, will I require the Life of Man: whoſoever ſheddeth Mans Bloud, by Man ſhall his Bloud be ſhed: for in the Image of Elohim, made he Man.</hi> Wherein is ſet forth a diſcovery of the premiſed Prerogative of <hi>Elohims</hi> Vicegerent, that he hath the foreſaid Title and Power over mens Livelihoods, by an <hi>Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Argument, a Majori ad Minus,</hi> from the Greater to the Leſſe: in as much as the height of earthly Power, (to wit, Power over mens Lives, by virtue of <hi>Elohims Sword</hi>) is clearly there recommended to him, and none elſe. For he muſt be more then Mans <hi>Brother,</hi> who may take away the Life of Man; and Life muſt be taken away from every <hi>Brother,</hi> that taketh away his <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> Life. The reaſon is, for that all men whatſoever (accidentally good or bad) are ſubſtantially and equally ennobled (for ought that man can take unto himſelfe, without GODS differentiall Note upon them) with the <hi>Image</hi> of GOD. And according to the Communication of that <hi>Image,</hi> they have the particular Dominions, which by GOD are diſpenſed in the ſeverall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions thereof, by its different Communication. All men have portion in it, and therefore, is the Life of all men ſacred; not to be taken away, but by him, whoſe the <hi>Image</hi> is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all have it not equally, for ſome have Dominion by it, to take away the life of ſome, who alſo have it.</p>
                  <p n="8">8.

BY this which hath been ſaid, it ſatisfactorily appears to every conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious man, who expects his Light from the Lamp of GODS revealed will, how from the beginning, GOD hath diſpoſed of his Power of <hi>Dominion.</hi> In which Point, ſince onely He hath Power to Conſtitute and Repeale; but hath Conſtituted and not Repealed, nor hath given Diſpenſation to any others whatſoever to doe it: Religious Sobriety would abundantly reſt contented with his bare exemplification of his mind, if there were no more to be ſaid in this caſe, then theſe <hi>Argumenta ad rem.</hi> But <hi>ad Hominem,</hi> (to the Oppoſing party) they ought to be eſteemed of double force; ſince they, who have undone the People by this plauſible colour, <hi>That all things whatſoever, whether to be beleeved or done; are to receive the particular warrant of their Legality, from the preciſe words of expreſſe Scripture;</hi> may leaſt of all men be endured in the Point of higheſt Concernment, to goe againſt the onely exemplifications of GOD in this kind, contained in the <hi>Scripture.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. In which particular (as appears by the horrible and amazing exceſſes, wherewith the Diſciples of the grand Enemy of the <hi>Word of God</hi> have openly blaſphemed it, to the infamy of the Age and Nation; what his aime is, even

in thoſe, whom hee cannot unto that Hereticall height bewitch) it hath in theſe dayes fallen out, as in all former Stories, no great Evill hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in its owne colours at firſt, but with a ſeeming Zeale to correct evils, and advance that, which moſt commonly rather ſeemed, then was good. So moſt ordinarily, when the Pretenders for the Peoples <hi>Liberty</hi> have by that Pretext deſtroyed their particular Adverſaries, <hi>Liberty</hi> it ſelfe by the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for it, hath been moſt deſperately deſtroyed.

                  <p n="3">3. So in the caſe of ſetting up the (Aereall) <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon Earth; when under the gay out-ſide thereof, they have deſpoiled thoſe that ſtand in their way; it is evident the prize was to <hi>lift [Him] up on High, that they might part his Garments amongſt them, and to caſt lots for his Coat.</hi> This is moſt evident, that, that cannot be <hi>Kingdome,</hi> the Power whereof muſt be in more then One, much leſſe in every one. That, that cannot be <hi>Chriſts,</hi> which ſeeketh its own. That, that cannot be Chriſts Kingdome, which comes not to fulfill, but to deſtroy any part of the Eternall and Univerſall Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Reaſon, or Nations; which came from Chriſt into the World before Chriſt came into the World himſelfe; who when he came, he came to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh, not to deſtroy that which he ſent before him, even to that of <hi>Moſes, Mat.</hi> 5. 17.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

                  <p n="9">9.

                  <p n="10">10.

                  <p>Concerning this Argument (which I take to be an irrefragably conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> deduced according to the exact rules of <hi>Logick, Ex veris, primis, immediatis, neceſſariis, cauſis concluſionis:</hi>) I ſhall onely recapitulate, that the <hi>Throne</hi> often mentioned, and particularly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 29, 36. cannot be underſtood of the <hi>Jewiſh Kings,</hi> the Lineal Succeſſors of the former <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in the former Covenant.

Gen. 17. 6.

                  <p n="1">1. IT is evidently manifeſt by this that hath beene proved; that <hi>Elohims</hi> whole Soveraignty over the whole world, both Heavenly and Earthly, is juſtly and actually conferred upon <hi>Immanuel,</hi> the <hi>Man Christ Jeſus:</hi> for the whole Line of time ſince, whether paſt, or to come: from the time of his Glorification and Aſcenſion.

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:102603:75"/>
of his Witneſſes (the <hi>Sun</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi>) by which mankind diſcernes the wayes of poore naturall life: ſo cannot all the world anſwer the numerous places of <hi>Scripture</hi> brought by them, to prove the <hi>Temporall Kingſhip,</hi> and <hi>Priesthood</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> on Earth; but by this Expoſition, conſonant to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Church</hi> truly <hi>Catholique;</hi> which being entertained, there remains nothing worthy of an Anſwer, in all that hath been by them Objected. And therefore I ſhall not miſ-ſpend time about them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But (here) let no man miſtake me, as if I intended, either in this, or the enſuing Chapter, that <hi>Christian Kings</hi> have a larger <hi>Right</hi> unto <hi>Dominion,</hi> abſtractively conſidered in it ſelfe [as <hi>Kingſhip,</hi>] then very <hi>Pagans,</hi> had, or have, before the Aſcenſion of <hi>Christ,</hi> or ſince; whileſt I affirme, that the <hi>Titles</hi> of <hi>Christian Princes</hi> are confirmed, explained, yea, dilated in their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials by <hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>Evangelicall Covenant.</hi> Which thing, without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſtature (though with addition of health and ſtrength) he hath done to the whole <hi>Morall Law,</hi> (as appeares by his <hi>Sermon</hi> in the <hi>Mount;</hi>) and therefore chiefly to this top-branch of Morality, borne with, and included in the fifth <hi>Commandement.</hi> My meaning is, that in <hi>Immanuel,</hi> is unclouded, irradiated, and invigorated, that which was before (from the beginning) more obſcurely under <hi>Elohim.</hi> As <hi>Christ</hi> having taken our nature upon him, is more expreſly, though not more juſtly, <hi>King</hi> of all, that was by him [the <hi>Word</hi>] created. And that the hands of Subjects are with ſeverer penalties now tyed up, from Reſiſtance of that Power, which is, and was GODS, and from the beginning. As the <hi>King</hi> doth not create me new <hi>Right</hi> to mine Eſtate, when he declares for it; and threatens further Mulcts upon the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders thereof; nor when he maketh a Covenant of Grace with me, that he will not take ſuch Forfeitures hereafter, as my Tenure hath been formerly liable unto: which I conceive to be the Difference between the Kings of the Gentiles, of the former Iſrael, and of Chriſtians.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>1. THe briefe remainder, will rather be Commentary then Text. The maine of the buſineſſe is tranſacted and proved. The Power and Thrones of the due Kingdome of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is for ever ſetled upon <hi>Chriſtian Princes:</hi> and that according to the generall <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Nations;</hi> as was petitioned for, and ratified, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. amongſt the former <hi>Iſrael</hi> of GOD. Of which Law, the one Headſhip of one Body, is a capitall part: and (upon the ſolution of Individuals to the frailty of Nature) the Proviſo of this Law, is the immediate deſcent of this <hi>Headſhip</hi> by Primogeniture, to avoid the unnaturalneſſe of <hi>Non-Headſhip;</hi> and to prevent the monſtrouſneſſe of <hi>many Heads;</hi> if the Law of Nature had not thus provided againſt innate ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance in every man, deſirous rather to create himſelfe an <hi>Head,</hi> then to continue that inferior part which the GOD of <hi>Nature</hi> made him; theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs had been inevitable.</p>

               <p>3. Now, as all other Lawes are (continually, but) only ſubject to him that gives them their <hi>Eſſe Formale,</hi> their full and laſt perfection of being Lawes: ſo this Law of <hi>Nature</hi> is onely liable to his Power, who is the GOD of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; (who will not give his Power to any, to uſe unjuſtly) and cannot be diſpenſed with, but by that Power which is <hi>Divine.</hi> From whence it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent whoſe Power (even) in the Family, the Father thereof holdeth: in whoſe behalfe GOD hath declared, (that though in <hi>Theſt,</hi> this Law be indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſable, yet) that in <hi>Hypotheſt,</hi> (to wit, in caſe of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> Ver. 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) it may be altered, and the younger Son preferred.

That it be not done out of Hatred to the diſinherited, or Fancy to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred; but for that which is indeed <hi>Rebellion,</hi> as is there to be read.</p>
               <p>4. Concerning <hi>Princes</hi> (not diſinheritable for their dereliction of the <hi>Thorah</hi> of GOD, as in the laſt Chapter) their Right of Succeſſion, muſt be more ſacred then other mens; for that they ſucceed, not onely according to the <hi>Common Law of Nature,</hi> but into the Right of the earthly Power of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (for the diſpenſing of the Rights of all others) as he is <hi>the Firſt-born of every creature;</hi> and for whoſe ſake, the <hi>Firstlings</hi> of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and other creatures were hallowed. And whoſe, not onely Right, but Power, is invaded by their oppoſers.</p>
               <p>5. Which Right, what ever the viſible meanes of Derivation were at the firſt, upon the continuance thereof, the Eſtabliſhment ſhall undoubtedly be reputed valid for GOD; as if himſelfe (who dwelleth in the Cloud, which no humane ſight can pierce into) had done immediately in the eyes of man, what he accepteth when it is done. This being the Law of GODS Prerogative for Vowes, <hi>Numb. 30. If one that is a Virgin, or a Wife,</hi> who hath not autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to make a Vow, for Conſecrations Perſonall or Reall, <hi>de Facto doth it; if the Father or Husband heareth, and holdeth his peace, the Vow ſhall ſtand good unto God.</hi> Much more in that which is his owne <hi>Province,</hi> (he being the ſole <hi>King of kings,</hi> and diſpoſer of <hi>Kingdomes</hi>) muſt thoſe who have read the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> know and take notice, that when they ſee a <hi>King</hi> ſet up, whoſe <hi>Root</hi> is faſtned in the Earth, and whoſe <hi>Branches</hi> have ſucceeded in growth; that it was onely GOD who was the Efficient and Author of his raiſing.</p>

When I read GOD to be the ſole diſpoſer of all Soveraignty, and himſelfe profeſſing his owne Act, that it was He himſelfe that did it; I dare not thinke that it was the others, but GOD alone by them who was the advancer of them, and of all ſuch, as he permits for a competent time, to take <hi>Root</hi> in that <hi>Mount</hi> of his peculiarity; whither none can come while he is aſleep, to ſteale in a Plant of his owne: which were it granted, yet its being planted there, alters the Property: If it be <hi>Rooted</hi> in the Throne, it is of GODS <hi>Planting.</hi> If he be a <hi>King,</hi> he is none of the <hi>Peoples chuſing,</hi> when they ſeeme moſt to doe it.

againſt whoſe Title (according to the Law of Nature) for generations and generations, there hath not been one amongſt all the ſons of men, who could pretend a colour; I ſuppoſe his Right, in, and through <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> as firmly eſtabliſhed by GOD, as ever (at the leaſt) theirs were; and more then all his Subjects.</p>

               <p>8.

It muſt be the living <hi>Deputy</hi> of the ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> living GOD, who muſt in the place of GOD, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the votes, and ſecure the well-wiſhes (yea, even from the <hi>Prerogative of God</hi>) unto thoſe, who claime aloud by it for themſelves.

But if man will enjoy the benefit of the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> he muſt doe the duty required by it; what, and to whom, GOD hath by it enacted, <hi>let him render;</hi> that he may receive from God what he holdeth out by it.

               <p>9. But I deſire not to retard this Diſcourſe, by intermixing of <hi>Metaphyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Speculations,</hi> concerning the glorious <hi>Singleneſſe</hi> of the <hi>Divine</hi> Power in his Operations, tranſcending the impurer Acts of created Man; working never by his owne, ſometimes by the Power of Gods Enemy: nor to direct the Queſtion, and fall upon the differencing of the Acts of God, and of the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:102603:78"/>
Creature. And therefore I ſhall draw no Arguments from hence, deſirous onely to have admitted,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That the Law of Nature is as equall unto the Succeſſion and Rights of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as to the Deſcent and Propriety of other men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That the Providence of the God of Nature, operateth, as well, and as faithfully, towards them, as others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>No unwritten Text of the Law of Nature, ought to be pretended againſt the written Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>That whereever God is recorded to have done otherwiſe, then in his Law of Nature is preſcribed; there is ever ſome important Myſtery included: and if there be no reaſon expreſſed for that ſpeciall Act; that, that is to be eſteemed for the reaſon, which God hath expreſſed elſewhere in Acts of the ſame nature, to be the ground of his ſo doing in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. Now (accordingly) with modeſty, and ſobriety to undertake the ſearch, why God, having eſtabliſhed by an everlaſting Covenant his earthly Dominion, in <hi>David,</hi> and his Heires, according to the Law of <hi>Nature;</hi> in the very firſt place of Succeſſion, refuſeth the <hi>Firſt-born;</hi> and by particular appointment maketh choyce of the younger? to wit, <hi>Solomon!</hi> For this I ſhall make bold with the parallels hereof in <hi>Scripture:</hi> but no further then the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> hath afforded light; concerning <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob; Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſhak.</hi> And therefore, I ſhall not diſcourſe of the Myſteries in the ſtory of the birth of <hi>Pharez</hi> and <hi>Zarah, Gen.</hi> 38. 28. which doubtleſſe was to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence further manifeſtation of the ſame thing, eaſily viſible. Nor ſhall I foretell for the preſent (till this that is certaine hath made way for it) the grounds of <hi>Moſes</hi> his preferring, before his elder brother <hi>Aaron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11. That which is undeniable, is ſet forth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. In which particular,<note place="margin">Vid. Orig. Ambr. Hier. in locum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <item>But that the ultimate Object, or principall drift of God, in preferring (againſt his Proviſo, in the Law of Nature) of the younger before the elder, (without reſpect unto their goodneſſe) in the ſpecified particulars of <hi>Iſhak</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> and <hi>Eſau:</hi> Was that, which God upon the Promulgation of the Covenant of Grace, did forthwith diſcover in his actions.</item>

               </list>
               <p>Whereof the grand particular of that Covenant, the eſtabliſhment of <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> for ſo long as Time ſhould be, muſt needs be a moſt conſiderable part; often expreſſed, as the regulative part of the whole. Whence it may appeare, that the end of GOD in theſe Acts, was not that which the engagements of this gainſaying Age would put upon Him: but the aſſertion of the <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Prerogative of GOD above his Lawes, to declare, what <hi>juſtly</hi> he may doe; and what <hi>de Facto,</hi> he hath done, (without injury meant or done to the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Houſe</hi>) for the younger Brethren of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>12. Concerning <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 24. 23. when <hi>Rebecca</hi> enquired GOD, concerning the Civill Wars in her womb; GOD anſwered, <hi>Two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are in it, and the younger People ſhall be ſtronger then the elder; and the elder ſhall ſerve the younger.</hi> Which ſervice was not literally to be underſtood, either of the perſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau;</hi> or of their reſpective generations; or ſo, as if either was <hi>abſolutely</hi> rejected; but that the <hi>younger</hi> Houſe of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was preferred in the <hi>Covenant. Jacob,</hi> the Father of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being the Type of theſe; <hi>Eſau,</hi> the elder Brother, being the Type of the People of the <hi>Jewes.</hi> For there is no abſolute reprobation concluded of thoſe, who were Typified in <hi>Eſau;</hi> for then Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe muſt have been rejected: as <hi>Rom. 11. 1. Hath God caſt away his People?</hi> (to wit, them of the elder Houſe) <hi>God forbid: For I alſo am an Iſraelite, &amp;c. God hath not caſt away his People, whom he foreknew, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Gen. 25. 26. Jacobs</hi> taking hold on the heele of <hi>Eſau</hi> at his birth, was the Figure of the immediate Succeſſion of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, and <hi>Covenant,</hi> into the Place and Rights of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall;</hi> by which trip, it got the ſtart of the former, into the Right of <hi>Primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniture;</hi> but both were the ſons of the ſame <hi>Iſhak;</hi> and neither did deſtroy other. And if any man would underſtand the conſtruction of the word [<hi>Hated] Rom.</hi> 9. 13. let him ſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26.</p>
               <p>13. Concerning the former paire of Brethren, <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſhak,</hi> (in whom the <hi>Covenants</hi> are looked upon as two; whereas in <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> they were twins of the ſame womb, and one continued birth.) the <hi>Apoſtle, Gal.</hi> 4. having in the beginning of the Chapter expreſſed, that the difference of the firſt and ſecond <hi>Covenant</hi> in the generall (as hath been proved of the grand Homogeneall part thereof, <hi>Dominion</hi>) was, but (at leaſt) as the <hi>Stock</hi> and the <hi>Graffe?</hi> as the <hi>Bloſſome</hi> and the <hi>Fruit,</hi> are two. For even in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of furtheſt diſtance in <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſhak,</hi> he yet concludes them there, to differ but as the ſame <hi>Heir, when he is a man, differeth from himſelfe a child.</hi> And Ver. 22. he affirmes <hi>in Terminis,</hi> that theſe two <hi>Brethren,</hi> and the <hi>two Mountaines, Sinai and Tſijon,</hi> were but <hi>Allegories;</hi> to repreſent the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the <hi>Evangelicall Covenant,</hi> into the <hi>Primogeniture</hi> of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:102603:79"/>
the <hi>Jewiſh People</hi> and <hi>Law,</hi> the former off-ſpring of GOD: as <hi>Exod. 4. 22. Jer.</hi> 10. 16.</p>
               <p>14. And alſo, that in the preferring of <hi>Iſhak,</hi> there was no un-ſonning of <hi>Iſhmeal,</hi> (however the Fancy of thoſe doth ſtand, who will not be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted without ſome others may be reprobated,) the Word of GOD is cleare, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 18. where <hi>Abraham</hi> (who was an underſtanding and loving Father, that knew what to aske) prayed for <hi>Iſhmael</hi> unto GOD; <hi>Oh that Iſhmael might [live before thee.</hi>] And Ver. 20. the Lord a moſt wiſe and faithfull GOD, who knew what was asked, returnes this anſwer; <hi>As concerning Iſhmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have bleſſed him, and will make him fruitfull; and will multiply him exceedingly: [twelve Princes] ſhall he beget; and I will make him [a great Nation.</hi>] Wherein was typified the one Nation of the People of the <hi>Jewes;</hi> and the twelve Tribes. Whereas in Ver. 4. <hi>Thou ſhalt be a Father of many Nations.</hi> And in Ver. 16. <hi>I will give thee a Son of her; yea, I will bleſſe her; and ſhe ſhall be a mother of [Nations] Kings of People ſhall be of her.</hi> But alas, this no time to diſport our ſelves into Theoreticall Diſputes.</p>
               <p>15. But if this Plea from theſe younger Brothers will not ſerve the turne, we are not altogether deſtitute of Proofs in this particular, concerning <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> Succeſſion; and the Reaſon thereof, in particular Texts: where we ſhall find this <hi>Solomon</hi> in a double capacity; as <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and as the Repreſenter of the <hi>Kings</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Nations.</hi> For this, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 12. ſaith GOD to <hi>David, I will ſet up of thy Seed after thee, &amp;c. He ſhall build an Houſe for my Name; and</hi> (as before) <hi>I will eſtabliſh the Throne of his Kingdome for ever. I will be his Father, and he ſhall be my Son. If he commit iniquity, I will chaſten him with the rod of men; and with the ſtripes of the children of men. But my Mercy ſhall not depart from him, as I tooke it from Saul, whom I put away before thee, and thine Houſe; and thy Kingdome ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever before thee.</hi> And in the very next words, (to expreſſe the undoubted certainty hereof) <hi>Thy Throne ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever. 1 Chron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 17. The ſame <hi>Covenant,</hi> and the ſame reaſon is related: but at Ver. 14. the Paraphraſe ſhewes, that the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>Kings;</hi> and the <hi>Kingſhip</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> is <hi>Gods. I will ſettle him in [mine Houſe] and in [my Kingdome] for ever: and his Throne ſhall be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed for evermore.</hi> Notwithſtanding all this, for the three grand parts of the long time ſince, neither <hi>Solomon</hi> nor <hi>David,</hi> have had a man to ſit upon the Thrones of <hi>Iſrael</hi> or <hi>Judah:</hi> and yet without all doubt, the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of <hi>God</hi> hath been fulfilled, according to the former demonſtrations; expreſſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122. 5. where this <hi>Throne</hi> of the <hi>One God</hi> upon Earth is in the Plural number, twice in one and the ſame Verſe, ſet downe <hi>Thrones: For there doe ſit the Thrones appointed for</hi> Miſhpat, (i.) <hi>Judgement; the Thrones of the Houſe of</hi> David.</p>
               <p>16. Now in the next place, we ſhall find <hi>Solomon</hi> the <hi>Type</hi> (whoſe Mother had had a former Husband, not of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to Nature)
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:102603:79"/>
in another condition; and conditionall upon his good behaviour: in the words of <hi>David</hi> a little before his death; in the preſence of the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> unto this <hi>Solomon</hi> his ſonne. 1 <hi>Chron. 28. 1. God ſaid unto me, Thou ſhalt not build mine Houſe, becauſe thou haſt been a man of War, and haſt ſhed bloud. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, the Lord God of Iſrael choſe me before all the Houſe of my Father, &amp;c. And of all my Sons, he hath choſen Solomon my Son, to ſit upon the Throne [of the Kingdome of the Lord] over Iſrael. And he ſaid unto me, He ſhall build mine Houſe and my [Courts,] for I have choſen him to be my Son, and I will be his Father: moreover, I will eſtabliſh his Kingdome for ever. [If he will be conſtant to doe my Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and my Judgements, as at this day.</hi>] This <hi>Solomon</hi> failed, and his Line hath been cut off, and the <hi>Throne</hi> it ſelfe demoliſhed. So that apparently, thoſe that have ſtood; to wit, the Typified <hi>Thrones</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Kings,</hi> muſt have been the <hi>Materiall Object</hi> of the Promiſe of GOD.</p>
               <p>17. That <hi>Solomon</hi> was the Type of <hi>Chriſtian Kings,</hi> appeares by <hi>Davids</hi> Propheticall, Praying, Benediction of him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. With which <hi>Pſalm,</hi> men have dealt, as ſome have uſed, when they could not hinder the true Heire from a Poſſeſſion, which themſelves aimed at; to Entitle the <hi>Prince</hi> to it, that they might worke their owne Ends, while they ſeem to ſerve the <hi>King.</hi> So here, when men either did not, or would not ſee the Power and Glory of <hi>Chriſtian Princes,</hi> to be the ultimate and typified intention thereof; and finding that little of it (but as to an unequall Type) could be convertible with <hi>Solomon.—Donabitur ergo nè pereat.</hi> They thinke to make it ſure for their owne availe, by Entitling <hi>Chriſt</hi> to it: whereas it ſuits far leſſe with <hi>Chriſt</hi> (divided from the Riches and Honour of his <hi>Adopted</hi> Sons of the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Houſe, the <hi>Kings</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>) then it did to <hi>Solomon,</hi> to whom they could not juſtifie it. So far was <hi>Chriſt</hi> from the Treaſures and Homage of the whole world, that when he was to pay his <hi>Fathers</hi> Tribute unto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he was faine to borrow it of a Fiſh: that he was deſpiſed, as but a poor <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters</hi> Son; and confeſſed himſelfe to be in a more indigent condition then the <hi>Birds</hi> and <hi>Foxes;</hi> and was ſo far from diſpenſing the <hi>Miſhpats,</hi> or Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>King, or the Kings Son,</hi> in the firſt Verſe of the <hi>Pſalme;</hi> that (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no externall Commiſſion) he refuſed, being intreated to interpoſe his private Authority in a cauſe <hi>Herciſcundae Haereditatis, Luke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 12. 14. Whereas indeed <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with his Divine Miracles and bitter Paſſion, was Typified in the great and ſtrange Victories and Sufferings of <hi>David. Davids</hi> younger Son preferred to the Crowne, his Peace and Glory was the Type of <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſemblable Heires of the younger Houſe of the <hi>Gentiles. In Chriſt for the Kings of the Nations; in the Kings of the Nations for Chriſt; can every letter of that Pſalm be juſtified, and of none elſe.</hi> And that <hi>Propheſie</hi> (which cannot be terminated either in <hi>Solomon</hi> alone, or with his naturall Succeſſors, who are extinct be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Sun;</hi> or in <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone, without the earthly Glory of thoſe who hold his earthly <hi>Throne</hi>) is to be underſtood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in them; is evinced,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:102603:80"/>
Verſe 17. <hi>Liphne Shemeſh jinnon ſhemo. His Name</hi> (to wit, of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>)<note place="margin">

               <p>18. <hi>Chriſtian Kings</hi> then who were Typified in <hi>Solomon,</hi> ought to have a care of that which is every where atteſted, to be that which honoured <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> in the eyes of his Honourer: to wit, the Materiall Houſes of GOD. Thus 2 <hi>Chron. 22. 8. The Word of God came unto me,</hi> (to wit, <hi>David) Thou haſt ſhed bloud aboundantly, &amp;c. Thou ſhalt not build an Houſe unto my Name, &amp;c.</hi> (Bloud, is as ill a Reformer, as a Builder in Religion) <hi>But behold a Son ſhall be borne unto thee; he ſhall be a man of reſt; he ſhall build an Houſe for my Name; and he ſhall be my Son, and I will be his Father: and I will eſtabliſh the Throne of his Kingdome over Iſrael for ever:</hi> which certainly remaines at this day. And not onely this, but the perpetuity of the <hi>Prieſthood;</hi> and <hi>Temple;</hi> with the Cathedrals, or <hi>Prieſts Courts,</hi> in the compaſſe thereof; was ſworne to, in the ſame Oath of GOD.</p>
               <p>19. But <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 46. where <hi>David found favour in the ſight of God: and yet</hi> it was <hi>Solomon who built him an Houſe:</hi> there is an <hi>Howbeit:</hi> to wit, <hi>That the moſt High dwelleth not in Temples made with hands;</hi> as ſaith the Prophet. <hi>Jer. 66. 1. Heaven is my Throne, and Farth is my Footſtoole. What Houſe will you build me? Or what is the place of my reſt? Hath not mine hand made all theſe things?</hi> Which words, the gainſayers of theſe dayes (whoſe I hope unwitting endeavours, are but to make <hi>God</hi> forſworn) catch at, without conſidering them in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; or comparing them with other Texts; concerning <hi>Gods expectation, and longing for a Temple, (Habitations</hi> indeed) His <hi>Contentation</hi> and <hi>Delight</hi> therein: His <hi>Inhabitancy</hi> and <hi>Propriety,</hi> in theſe places of his <hi>Reſt,</hi> from men of reſt expected; if they would have their owne confirmed.</p>
               <p>20. In themſelves, the words concerning his Throne in Heaven, can but import, that when man hath done all that he can, <hi>God</hi> hath of his owne making a more magnificent <hi>Temple</hi> in Heaven, (in compariſon whereof, thoſe on Earth, are but as the <hi>Footſtoole</hi> of his <hi>Throne</hi> there) which indeed can no more <hi>Terminatively</hi> (though more <hi>Gloriouſly</hi>) containe his <hi>Immenſity,</hi> then the leaſt on Earth. And that nothing made, is truly fit for, or worthy of the <hi>Creator:</hi> which ſhould rather excite them (as the Bleſſings of <hi>God</hi> encreaſe) to be more and more Munificent, in making his Earthly <hi>Habitations;</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach as neer as may be in <hi>Glory</hi> unto his <hi>Heavenly</hi> Seat.</p>
               <p>21. The Pattern of which <hi>Temple</hi> (as unto <hi>Moſes</hi> for the Tranſitory <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle</hi>) was (as the <hi>Icon,</hi> or <hi>Image</hi> of that Heaven) from Heaven in repreſented unto <hi>David</hi> by the <hi>Spirit of God, 1 Chron.</hi> 28. 12. to be built by <hi>Solomon</hi> the younger Son of <hi>David,</hi> the Type as of <hi>Chriſtian Kings</hi> in generall; ſo more particularly of <hi>Conſtantine the Great,</hi> who forthwith upon the finall diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this <hi>Temple</hi> built by the former <hi>Solomon,</hi> decreed [<hi>Habitatious</hi>] to be
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:102603:80"/>
built throughout his Empire (which was then accounted the World) <hi>to the mighty God of Jacob;</hi> who was the younger ſon of <hi>Iſhak;</hi> who was the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſon of <hi>Abraham;</hi> into the <hi>Primogeniture</hi> of whoſe Covenant, the younger People of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and their <hi>Kings</hi> were Adopted, according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of <hi>God.</hi> Though during the nonage of Chriſtianity, <hi>God</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent (as under <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Judges,</hi> to dwell under <hi>Curtaines;</hi> ſo) to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite in the <hi>Tops</hi> of mens Houſes, untill he ſent a compleat <hi>Monarch</hi> (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable unto <hi>Solomon</hi> amongſt <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>22. And yet our <hi>Saviour</hi> was ſo zealous for the Type, that onely in the cauſe thereof (throughout his whole life) the <hi>Lamb of God</hi> fell to blowes; aſſerting that, that which was indeed his <hi>Fathers Houſe, was the Houſe of Prayer</hi> (not naming any thing elſe) <hi>unto all Nations.</hi> Whereas that which he ſeemed to fight for, might not be entred by any, but thoſe of the <hi>Circumciſion.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 3. made (for Chriſtians) the <hi>Temple of God, the principall Analogatum</hi> of Holineſſe; a modell to teach all thoſe who expected the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitancy of <hi>God</hi> in the more minute <hi>Temples</hi> of their Bodies; in ſemblable Holineſſe to preſerve their Sanctity: affirming that <hi>God would deſtroy him, that but defiled his Temple.</hi> But Saint <hi>Pauls holy Materiall Temple,</hi> if the <hi>Father</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by his Wars, may not build; the <hi>Son</hi> ſhall.</p>
               <p>23. But to proceed; whoſe the Throne is, his is the Power: and if the Power thereof be GODS, certainly it is Supreme on Earth, and Irreſiſtible; and that <hi>King Solomons</hi> (I ſuppoſe it ſo ſet downe, to expreſſe GODS more valuable intereſt in the Chriſtian Throne then any other) was the <hi>Throne of God,</hi> is ſhewed in the fore-cited words of 1 <hi>Chro. 28. 5. He hath choſen Solomon to ſit upon the Throne of his Kingdome; (per Eminentiam)</hi> yea, the <hi>Kingdome of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah,</hi> for the more Religions ſake, amongſt all who are of the Iſrael of GOD. If this be not enough, it ſhall be juſtified for them all, according to the <hi>Axiome</hi> in <hi>Logick; Quicquid competit alicui, quà tali, competit omni tali:</hi> That which appertaineth to any, as ſuch; appertaineth to every one, that is ſuch. The place is, 1 <hi>Chro. 29. 23.

So that manifeſt it is, that the <hi>Kinds Throne</hi> upon Earth (eſpecially amongſt Chriſtians) is to be reputed GODS earthly <hi>Throne;</hi> out of which he is never, while the <hi>King</hi> is there: and the <hi>King</hi> is never out, while GOD is there. And this is the reaſon, why (out of the <hi>Religion</hi> thereof) we uncover our heads, and make our obeyſance towards the <hi>Kings</hi> Throne, or chaire of State; even when we are as ſure, as our eyes can make us, that our earthly <hi>King</hi> is not therein. Anſwerable hereunto, is the Homage which we perform towards the viſible <hi>Monument</hi> of his Preſence, in the <hi>Materiall Temple;</hi> where we are ſure that he alwayes dwelleth, and never can be from home.

               <p>25. Laſtly, it being made apparent (for <hi>Chriſtian Princes</hi>) that the Throne of the Divine Power is the <hi>Kings;</hi> and that the Power of the Earthly Throne is GODS; little will need to be ſaid concerning that Prerogative, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth unto the <hi>Kings King;</hi> in the hand of him that adminiſtreth it, for GOD and not for Man. <hi>That, that Power must be unlimited by Man, which is not bounded by any Poſitive Law of God. That, that which is Divine, and by God uncen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, cannot come within the reach of man to cenſure.</hi> Accordingly did <hi>Solomon</hi> in the higheſt of all our controverted Points, by his ſole <hi>Regall</hi> Power, in putting to death the greateſt in his Dominions, <hi>Adoniah</hi> his eldeſt brother; <hi>Joab,</hi> whom his Father feared.

               <p>I acknowledge it a miſtake in the Impreſſion of 1631. <hi>I will build [Me] a ſure Houſe.</hi> But were it added to the Tranſlation by way of Paraphraſe, [<hi>I will build Me</hi>] (to, or) for him, (<hi>viz.</hi> to officiate in) <hi>a ſure Houſe;</hi> I conceive it would more fully render the Latitude of the words in the Originall, both Text and Context. For it is evident, that (in that <hi>Propheſie</hi>) was foreſhewed; the diſſolution of the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> erected by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Succeſſion both of firme Prieſthood and Temple, under an eſtabliſhed anointed Monarch: which was performed in the perſons of <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Zadok,</hi> the two

               <p>It is in the Margin of our laſt Tranſlation, Ver. 32.

                  <p>The Authors Reaſon for not beginning with the End of Dominion. The Reaſon why God himſelfe retroceded from the immediate exerciſe of his juſt Monarchy; that Man might not by his Juſtice be conſumed. The Reaſon why Prieſthood is not adminiſtred by the Angels. God (by thus doing) doth not onely accommodate our Perſons, but dignifie our whole Nature. The Fundamental Axiomes (in this Tract) recollected. The unalterableneſſe of Gods Ground, for the unalterableneſſe of theſe Conſtitutions. This great vouchſafing of God, doth diſplay unto us the Blemiſhes of our proud frailty, as doe our clothes, and the written Word of God. Saint <hi>Peters</hi> cautions againſt wresting of Scriptures. What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth to be hereafter treated upon.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. I Have deduced that which will prove (alone) to be <hi>Dominion</hi> from the <hi>ſole Originall</hi> thereof, unto the full eſtabliſhment of it, in the unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Covenant</hi> of the <hi>Goſpell;</hi> unto which, whoſoever addes a divers <hi>new one, is ipſo Facto</hi> (as hath been ſhewed) excommunicated, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8. though he be <hi>an Angell from Heaven.</hi> If I had not lived in an age, which denieth <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;</hi> particularly this, <hi>That all juſt Dominion (in Earth, as well as Heaven) is ſolely and Originally Gods:</hi> I had been to blame (as an ill <hi>Logician</hi> and <hi>Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſt)</hi> for not beginning at the <hi>End. Which</hi> (as hath been ſaid) <hi>is the compoſure of Earth according to the Image and Likeneſſe of Heaven; for the juſt, orderly, and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:102603:88"/>
laſting preſervation of its happineſſe.</hi> This ſhall be explained and juſtified in a particular ſhort Commentary on the <hi>Lords Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Reaſon of Dominion thus eſtabliſhed</hi> (as hath been manifeſted) <hi>is the preſervation of mankind</hi> (through the compaſſion of the Almighty) <hi>from his very ſelfe.</hi> This is apparent, <hi>Exod. 33. 3.

Both of which, are by the incomparableneſſe of his moſt mercifull vouchſafings, interpoſed between Him and Us; to keep at a diſtance the <hi>Immediateneſſe</hi> of our <hi>Impiety</hi> and his <hi>Juſtice.</hi> This man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the exerciſing of his <hi>Monarchy,</hi> being mans ſecurity and ſhelter from GOD; whereby the Terrours of his Majeſty viſibly reigning over us, doe not (once for all) appall and confound us: with the Honour of whoſe Juſtice it could not otherwiſe ſtand, if he ſhould not preſently ſtrike for every <hi>Inſolency</hi> committed againſt his <hi>Highneſſe.</hi>

                  <hi>It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, that for this cauſe, Kingdome was adjourned from Heaven to Earth, that man might have on Earth a Sanctuary of refuge from the inexorable ſeverity of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty, by the exerciſe of Gods Dominion, by one, whoſe breath (like other mens) is in his noſtrils;</hi> That ſo GOD might not be neceſſitated each moment, to fill the world with the deſtructions of ſinfull, proud, duſt and aſhes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When <hi>Iſrael ſaw the Thundrings and Lightnings,</hi> (Exod. 20. 18.) <hi>and heard the noiſe of the Trumpet of God, and beheld the Mountaine ſmoaking: when they ſaw this, they removed and stood afar off; and ſaid to Moſes, Speake thou with us, and we will heare; but let not God ſpeake with us leſt we die.</hi> So likewiſe for the Peoples ſake it is, That the <hi>Prieſthood</hi> is not executed by the <hi>Angels;</hi> yea, for their honour too, if they pleaſe to conſider it. And therefore, <hi>Deut. 18. 17. the Lord</hi> ſweetly accepted the deſires of his People in this kind, and ſaid, <hi>They have well ſpoken;</hi> to wit, <hi>that they might not heare againe the voyce of Jehovah Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him; nor ſee that great fire any more, leſt they ſhould periſh</hi> And thereupon GOD promiſed <hi>to raiſe them up of their Brethren, a Prophet, whom they might heare in ſtead of the Archangel;</hi> unto whom the Promulgation of the Law was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated.</p>
               <p n="5">5.

                  <hi>are in eminent Place and Power, ſtand in more need of pity from others, and patience in themſelves; then any others, for the reliefe of their Servitude and Vaſſallage. Our God is a conſuming fire;</hi> Man in his place ſhall be conſumed, if he doe not ſhed forth upon us the goodneſſe of GOD, for the end of his placing there: much more if he doe conſume us, though he be adopted; nay, becauſe he is adopted into the dreadfull Power and ſacred Name of <hi>Elohim.</hi> Thus farre hath GOD (with infinite mercy) vouchſafed, and no further. <hi>And who may ſay unto him, What doeſt thou?</hi>
